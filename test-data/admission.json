    "content": "Frequently asked questions about applying to Denison. We offer Early Decision 1, Early Decision 2, and Regular Decision. Please note that Early Decision is binding, meaning that if you are admitted in an Early Decision round, you are committing to enroll at Denison and withdraw any applications you have submitted to other institutions. There are two primary advantages to applying as an Early Decision applicant. First, a higher percentage of students are admitted in Early Decision—as the pool of applicants is smaller than in Regular Decision. If you are confident that Denison is the right fit for you, we encourage you to consider applying as an Early Decision applicant. Second, you find out if you’ve been admitted sooner! ED applicants typically receive their admission decisions about 1 month after each ED deadline (RD applicants receive decisions in mid-March). The ED1 deadline is November 15 and ED2 deadline is January 15. There is no difference in how applicants are reviewed between the ED1 and ED2 rounds. In Early Decision rounds, students are notified on a rolling basis once the Office of Admission has received all the required application materials. All decisions will be released within one month of the application deadlines. In the Regular Decision round, our application deadline is January 15th, and all applicants receive their admission decisions by mid-March. Absolutely, as long as you do so before February 20th. You should email us at admission@denison.edu to let us know you would like to make this change, and we will require you complete the early decision agreement (requiring your signature, along with a parent’s and a counselor’s signatures.) Perfection…just kidding. In evaluating your application to Denison, we take a number of things into consideration about you as an individual. We are seeking students who have demonstrated a seriousness toward their academic lives and who, in addition, would bring a variety of interests, characteristics, and personal qualities to our dynamic campus community. Typically, applicants who are admitted to Denison take challenging courses in their high schools and have done well in those courses. We also consider test scores, if you choose to submit them (see our test optional policy). Denison’s community is largely characterized as a highly engaged one with many opportunities. As such, we are looking for students who have demonstrated that they are involved in their passions and have taken advantage of the opportunities they’ve been provided thus far. It is important to note: Quality over quantity is valued here. Taking on a high level of involvement in one or two passions is much more impactful than involvement in 100 activities that you simply “show up” for. Think of this as synonymous to when your crushes passed you notes in elementary school asking you if you liked them (we know, no one passes notes anymore). College admission kind of works the same way. We provide a lot of ways for you to learn more about us and for us to learn more about you. When you engage with us, we get the hint that you might like us. And of course, we want to admit people who like us. Again, there are so many ways to engage: visiting campus, participating in one of our many virtual offerings, completing an admission interview, reading our emails, submitting an arts supplement…the list goes on. And don’t forget, the best way to tell us you like us is to APPLY! Absolutely! No questions asked! Actually- Denison has no application fee, and we accept self-reported test scores (if you choose to submit them). So, there should be no fees associated with your application for admission. Please note that if you are applying for financial aid, the CSS Profile requires a $25 application fee. Once you’ve submitted your application, you can’t make any edits. If you need to make a change to something like your essay or activity list, please email <a href=\"mailto:admission@denison.edu\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">admission@denison.edu</a> with the updated information and it’ll be added to your file. You will get an email from Denison confirming that we have received your application. In addition, you will receive your credentials to log in to your applicant portal. In your applicant portal, you will be able to see a checklist of required application materials. If any of those materials are missing, we provide further information on how you are able to ensure they are submitted. Pro Tip: Approach the college application process in an organized manner and give plenty of notice to the people submitting items on your behalf (e.g. counselors with high school transcripts, teachers with recommendations, etc.). Students interested in cinema, creative writing, dance, music, studio art, or theatre are encouraged to submit supplementary arts materials for evaluation. If submitted, materials will be reviewed by members of the arts faculty in the designated area(s) and students become eligible to receive a scholarship. By sharing a portfolio, students are able to showcase their artistic talents, regardless of their major. You can submit your portfolio by simply uploading your materials through your applicant portal. You will receive your portal login information once you have submitted your application. <a href=\"https://denison.edu/forms/fineperforming-arts-supplements\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Recommendations on what you should consider submitting.</a> After you submit your Common Application or Coalition Application to Denison, you will receive an email with information on how to log in to your <a href=\"http://connect.denison.edu/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">applicant portal</a>. We hate this answer, but it is the one we have to give. It depends. <a href=\"/academics/registrar/transfer-credit\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Start by taking a look at this information provided by our Registrar’s Office</a>. If you have specific questions, we encourage you to follow up at <a href=\"mailto:registrar@denison.edu\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">registrar@denison.edu</a>. Regardless of what type of credit you receive, remember that Denison is designed as a four year experience, and you should plan on spending four years here to complete your degree requirements. We do not have a minimum GPA as every application is reviewed holistically. While your GPA may indicate how you will do at Denison, the rigor of your courses is equally important. There are no set courses required to be considered for admission. However, admission to Denison is highly competitive. Typically, the most competitive applicants complete four years of English and at least three years of mathematics, foreign language, science, and social studies during high school. We also encourage you to challenge yourself with rigorous courses, when available and within reason. Nope. We have a test-optional admission policy. If you do not submit a test-score, that’s a-okay with us. Our admission committee will simply focus on the other components of your application (transcripts, curriculum rigor, etc.) when evaluating your academic ability and potential. Absolutely not. We have been test optional long enough to know that students without test scores can be phenomenal members of the Denison community, and if we see things we like in your transcript, essays, and letters of recommendation, we won’t hesitate to admit you. We accept both official and self-reported scores. Official scores need to come directly from the testing agency or an official at your school (principal, counselor, teacher, etc.). If you self-report your score and choose to enroll, we will require you to submit an official score report. While “superscore” sounds like a video game accomplishment, it is actually in reference to standardized testing. Yes, Denison superscores, meaning that we take your highest section scores across all instances you took the ACT or SAT. It is important to note that when you submit your scores you need to submit all test section scores for each time you took a standardized test. Our admission committee will recalculate your superscore based on all of your test scores. We would love to host you and your family on campus. The Office of Admission is open most weekdays (barring some holidays), and during the academic year, we offer Saturday visit options. You can easily schedule a visit <a href=\"http://visit.denison.edu/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">online</a> or by calling our office at 740-587-6276. Please note that as we monitor the COVID-19 situation, our utmost priority is to ensure the safety of our students, faculty, staff, and visitors. As such, we may need to change or cancel admission events as new information becomes available. Don’t sweat it. There are a lot of ways to learn more about us virtually—webinars, information sessions, virtual interviews, videos, and more. <a href=\"https://denison.edu/campus/admission/virtual-connections\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Start here</a>. Also, don’t forget to check your email frequently, we will keep you posted as more opportunities arise. Our students represent diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, races, ethnicities, religions, sexual orientations, political beliefs, abilities, and gender identities. In glancing at our student body, 21% of our students are domestic students of color and 16% are <a href=\"/campus/admission/international-applicants\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">international students</a>. We value, and celebrate diversity at Denison. ",

You may apply for need-based financial aid only during the admission process. International students who enroll at Denison without need-based financial aid cannot apply for funding in the&nbsp;future. We do not accept the CSS Profile for international applicants. Instead, we use our own form, the Denison <a href=\"/forms/certification-of-finances\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Certification of Finances</a>. The Certification of Finances is free to submit. Once you are admitted and choose to attend Denison, you will receive the I-20 Form needed to obtain your F1 visa&nbsp;(NOT a visitor visa). Please read the information on the form carefully.&nbsp;Along with your passport, the visa is needed to avoid immigration problems during your stay in the United States. We have study abroad opportunities, faculty and staff who help students achieve their goals, and many different programs that focus on multicultural areas of&nbsp;study. Besides interacting with classmates from various backgrounds, international students can also join organizations with multicultural focuses, where they can embrace their individuality and get to know other students with similar interests. Throughout the year, we also offer numerous lectures, concerts, and events that introduce our community to new art forms, cultures, and ways&nbsp;of&nbsp;life. Denison sponsors a non-residential host (<a href=\"/campus/international-students/international-friendship-program\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">International Friendship Program</a>) family program that brings international students together with local families. Host families give international students the opportunity to learn more about our culture, and they can introduce their students to the local community and off-campus life. In turn, local families are able to expand their own horizons through friendships with students from other countries. International students meet their host families upon arrival and occasionally throughout their time at Denison. While there are different levels of involvement that are agreed upon between students and host families, most host families meet their student during the orientation program and make a commitment to spend some time together during the year. For international students, the program is voluntary, so students requesting host families should be genuinely interested in learning more about family life in the United States and developing personal relationships beyond the college campus. <a href=\"/campus/international-students\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">International Student Services</a> offers students who have been educated abroad the tools, guidance, and instruction to engage and perform at their optimal level in the U.S. academic domain. ISS provides a pre-orientation program for entering students, one-on-one advising on the academic, social, and personal challenges associated with living and learning in an unfamiliar culture, and continuing education on the immigration regulations, requirements, and expectations pertinent to the non-immigrant student visa. Yes, we have the&nbsp;<a href=\"/campus/international-students/student-groups\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Denison International Students Association (DISA)</a>. This very active group is run by students. The association frequently holds meetings to discuss general student concerns and to plan upcoming events such as holiday celebrations, retreats, International Week, and debates on international issues.

If you choose to be a test-optional admission candidate, simply select that option on your application, and we will focus on all the other things that make you great. Proof that the phrase “Nothing good in life is free” is pure fallacy. Put that money toward your phone bill or something much more fun than app fees. That’s us helping you find time to rewatch a few episodes of The Office for the 100th time—or is that just us? If you are currently or previously enrolled at an accredited post-secondary institution, you must apply to Denison as a transfer applicant, and if you are admitted you will receive a Transfer Credit Evaluation detailing how your previous credits will transfer to Denison. Transfer students interested in Denison must submit the Denison Transfer Application. Spring (January start) Fall (August start) Application Deadline November 15 April 15 Notification Rolling basis in Nov/Dec Rolling basis starting in April Reply Date Two weeks after receiving admission decision June 1 or two weeks after receiving admission decision, whichever is later In evaluating your application to Denison, we take a number of things into consideration about you as an individual. We are seeking students who have demonstrated a seriousness toward their academic life and who, in addition, would bring a variety of interests, characteristics, and personal qualities to our dynamic campus community. In many cases, successful transfer applicants to Denison are earning As or Bs in their current courses, whether that be in a liberal arts or other environment. We are able to receive transcripts directly from a high school or college as well as through the Common Application, SCOIR or Parchment. Transfer students live where every other student lives: <a href=\"/tour?page=11\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">on campus</a>. As a transfer you will live in any of the buildings designated for returning students. When possible, we try to assign transfer students together and with their entering class year. Once you make your deposit and enroll for courses, more information will be provided on room and potential roommate selection preferences. In order to graduate from Denison, a student needs to earn 64 credit hours at Denison. This equates to about 4 semesters of coursework wherein a student takes a standard 4 classes (16 credits) each semester. Most core academic courses are four credit hours each. Thus, at minimum, transfer students are usually at Denison for two years before graduation. Denison accepts up to 62 hours of transfer credit. If admitted, you will receive a Transfer Credit Evaluation with your admission decision that outlines how your previous credits transferred into Denison and map toward degree completion and general education requirements. Generally, transfer credits from similar courses as those offered at Denison will transfer into their respective departments or toward your major, although individual academic departments ultimately need to approve transfer requests for major or minor credit. Yes, transfer students can study abroad during the academic year or summer break. Studying abroad during the academic year could prove to be difficult for students who transfer in after the start of Junior year. No more than 62 transfer credits can be applied towards graduation from Denison — this includes study abroad credits and any credits transferred in from previous institutions. <a href=\"/academics/study-abroad/how-it-works\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Summer study abroad opportunities</a>, as well as <a href=\"/academics/seminars\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Denison seminars</a>, are great opportunities for all transfer students to spend time away from campus. In the weeks after you pay your deposit, you will be receiving information on transitioning to the Denison community. <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"71e42412-d04f-45ef-8719-be5e849caefd\" href=\"/people/mark-moller\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Mark Moller, Dean of Transfer Students</a>, will reach out to you to register you for courses and you will begin to work on your enrollment checklist. After completing your checklist, incoming transfer students will be assigned a residence hall and room, and attend a transfer-specific orientation before classes start (either in August or January). During your first semester at Denison, you will have the opportunity to gather with other new transfer students on a monthly basis. Dean of Transfer Students, Mark Moller, and current upper class transfer students lead this informal time for those in the transfer community to share a meal and catch up with one another as they adjust to life at Denison. Generally, Denison welcomes about 15 transfer students every Spring (January) and about 30-40 every Fall (August). Additionally, about 30+ new Spring Start first-year students will also join the campus in January. Although not transfer students, they are also new Denisonians to campus. At the start of each semester there is an involvement fair where students can sign up for our 160+ student orgs. Spring transfer students can expect to attend the winter involvement fair in January and Fall transfer students will check out the Fall activities fair on <a href=\"/tour?page=1\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">A-Quad</a> during the first week of classes. Students can also join and engage with campus organizations at any time after that. Transfer students coming in with twelve or more credit hours are welcome to join organizations in <a href=\"/campus/get-involved/fraternity-sorority-life\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Fraternity and Sorority life</a> too. In general, Denison students are really engaged in <a href=\"/campus/get-involved\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">co-curricular involvement</a> and transfer students can expect an equal opportunity to jump into campus organizations. All transfer students will receive initial advising from Mark Moller, Dean of Transfer Students to go over registration and transcript evaluation at the beginning of your Denison career. Interested prospective students are welcome to sign up for a Transfer Credit Evaluation with Dean Moller to discuss how their credits might transfer to Denison in advance of submitting their application. Yes. About 15 students join Denison for the start of the Spring semester (January) every year. Dean of Transfer Students, Mark Moller, and other transfer student leaders will lead spring transfers through a similar orientation program as those who start in the Fall, typically the weekend before classes begin. You might be surprised at how lively Denison is. Denison is truly a unique place — a small school with lots of school spirit, in a quaint college town with lots of connections to a big city, and a liberal arts college that feels much more like a research university. Transfers from larger cities or colleges are often shocked at how many things there are to do on campus, in the town of Granville, and in the city of Columbus. Additionally, students are very friendly — it can be surprising if you’re not from the Midwest! Denison’s residential, tight-knit campus makes it easier to feel welcomed into our community. You’ll likely know your professors and peers much more closely and establish relationships with people in all parts of campus. Though coming from a large city or school to Granville, Ohio might seem like a stark change, our vibrant student body and eclectic town will often pleasantly surprise students coming from other environments. Absolutely. Though coming in later during your college career is more challenging, if you are willing to hit the ground running with your academics and involvement, Denison is the place for you. Many students who have only two years at Denison have engaging and fulfilling experiences. Yes, both international and domestic transfer students at Denison are eligible for aid. There is no additional application for students to be considered for merit aid, simply submit the Denison Transfer Application and you will be eligible. Domestic applicants wishing to be considered for need-based aid will need to opt-into that by submitting a FAFSA and CSS Profile by the application deadline (Nov 15 or April 15). All International applicants are required to submit a Denison Certificate of Finances. Students will be notified of their aid packages at the time of admission.

All previous first-year applicants to Denison are welcome to apply as transfer students. Denison does not accept the Common Application for transfer admission, and thus students must fill out a new <a href=\"https://connect.denison.edu/apply/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Denison Transfer Application</a>. If you submitted a final high school transcript and/or SAT/ACT scores with your first-year application we will roll them into your transfer record. Otherwise, we ask that you provide the necessary transfer application materials to our office. If you are a previous Denison student seeking to re-enroll at the College you may need to re-apply for admission. To determine the best next step for you please complete the <a href=\"https://connect.denison.edu/register/reenroll\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Denison Re-Enrollment form</a> and a member of our team will contact you. Denison provides a personalized world-class education to our students and to that end, we like to get to know hopeful Denison students as soon as possible. A great place for a first conversation is an admission interview. The interview is more of an informal discussion about the transfer process and the students’ academic journey towards a transfer decision than an intimidating interrogation. Interviews are about 30 minutes long and are conducted virtually via zoom as well as on campus. Please contact Jesse Leary Yeager ‘10 (<a href=\"mailto:yeagerj@denison.edu\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">yeagerj@denison.edu</a>) for more information or to schedule a conversation.

Successful transfer applicants to Denison, in many cases, are earning As or Bs in their current courses, whether that be in a liberal arts or other environment. Denison does not emphasize standardized testing for transfer applicants, although applicants are welcome to submit unofficial ACT/SAT scores. In absence of any complete college courses, the admission team will look to a final high school transcript to gauge students’ academic abilities. Admission interviews and letters of recommendation are entirely optional, although admission interviews can be particularly advantageous. Any student who has earned college credits after graduating from high school should apply to Denison as a transfer student. Applicants who completed college credits while in high school, but who have not yet attended a post-secondary institution as a degree-seeking student should submit a <a href=\"/campus/admission/apply-for-admission\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">first-year application</a>. Denison does not admit transfer applicants who have previously earned a Bachelor’s degree. Denison provides all admitted transfer students a complete credit evaluation at the time of admission. International students frequently have some, if not most, of their credits transfer to Denison, relative to what types of courses they have taken. For questions about credit transfer please contact <a href=\"/people/mark-moller\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Mark Moller</a>, Dean of Transfer Students.

Please note, we do require a few additional materials (see requirements section above) to consider your application complete. There is never a fee to apply for admission to Denison. As a QuestBridge Scholar at Denison, you do not have to pay for standard direct costs for the duration of your program at Denison. Standard direct costs are considered tuition, multiple occupancy housing, and “The Hill” meal plan. You are responsible for any additional costs beyond standard tuition, housing, and meals. This includes, but is not limited to flights/transportation, books/supplies, and personal expenses. Those costs can vary by student, but are generally around $2,500 annually. Additionally, all students attending Denison are required to maintain health insurance. Students with their own health insurance through a family member or exchange may choose to waive Denison’s health insurance plan. All others without sufficient health insurance are required to purchase Denison’s health insurance plan. For the 2022-23 academic year, the cost of this plan is $1,426. There are other various charges that you could accrue throughout your program that you would be responsible for as well, depending on what <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"ce5ce754-cf2a-47bf-b4aa-6ef2f035a4c0\" href=\"/campus/finances/tuition-costs\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">optional offerings you choose to pursue</a>. Yes, you can select any housing or meal plan that you want, but it is important to note that your financial aid will cover the cost of multiple occupancy housing and “The Hill” meal plan. If you select a more expensive option, like a single room or an apartment, you are responsible for the difference in cost between that plan and the standard plan. The U.S. government considers grant or scholarship money that is applied to living costs (housing, meals) to be a taxable benefit. Not finding what you are looking for?

We help students find their academic footing, build deep friendships, and secure faculty and staff mentors. Our campus culture is welcoming, inspiring, fun, and diverse by every definition. <strong>What Denison Offers</strong> Denison is proud to partner with the Army ROTC detachment at Capital University, providing our students the opportunity to train to become officers in the United States Army. Denison students participate in the required classes and training at Capital, all while benefiting from the Denison academic and student experience. <strong>The Application</strong> Students interested in Army ROTC should apply to Denison through the normal admission process. There are no additional application requirements at Denison for students interested in Army ROTC. Students should contact the Army ROTC detachment at Capital University regarding the process for participation and scholarships with Army ROTC. <strong>Financial Aid Process</strong> For students who earn an Army ROTC scholarship for the detachment at Capital University, Denison is committed to providing grant aid so the student’s entire comprehensive fee at Denison is covered while receiving the Army ROTC scholarship. This includes Denison tuition, as well as standard housing and meals. For three-year scholarship recipients in their first year at Denison, Denison uses the same financial aid process that it uses for all admitted students. Army ROTC students receive a Denison grant to pay for the required Army ROTC first-year courses through Capital. During the second, third, and fourth years, their initial financial aid and scholarship package is forfeited and replaced by an Army scholarship equal to the cost of Denison’s tuition. Additionally, during the three scholarship years, Denison provides sufficient grant aid to ensure that their entire comprehensive fee at Denison (i.e., tuition, plus standard housing, and meals) are covered with scholarships and grants. Students are required to take classes and instruction at Capital University. All students are able to have cars on Denison’s campus. However, if students participating in the ROTC program do not have their own means of transportation, they are able to reserve Denison vans to drive to Capital. A valid driver’s license and completion of an on-campus driver’s test are required before reserving a vehicle. Please contact Campus Safety if you have questions about the van rental process at Denison.

Denison is a Platinum Partner with the <a href=\"https://chicagoscholars.org/programs\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Chicago Scholars Foundation</a>, an organization that serves academically ambitious, first-generation college students from under-resourced communities in Chicago. The organization supports 3,000+ Scholars and Alumni each year in a seven-year program model built on three phases: college access, college success, and career mentoring. As a Platinum Partner, Denison pledges to meet 100% of demonstrated financial need—through graduation—for Chicago Scholars. We also sponsor a campus visit prior to an admitted Scholar confirming enrollment, and provide an on-campus liaison for Scholars. Denison is a proud partner to <a href=\"https://mcocp.org/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">College Promise</a>, an organization founded by a Denison alumnus&nbsp;based in Montgomery County, Ohio. College Promise works to help alleviate the poverty cycle for students who have indicated academic promise to make the dream of college a reality. Students who qualify for the College Promise Scholarship began the College Promise program in eighth grade. For Denison’s selection process, College Promise seniors are competitively selected as candidates for the scholarship during the fall. At that point, candidates will come to Denison’s campus for a visit and interview. Decisions will be made after the interview process. Denison values its relationship with our big-city neighbor, Columbus, through the Denison-Columbus Alliance, which provides total grant aid of at least the full cost of tuition for select high-achieving students from the Columbus City Schools. This program is offered in partnership with I Know I Can, the only college-access program in Columbus. High school seniors attending Columbus City Schools and working with I Know I Can are invited to apply for this opportunity. Scholars will be selected based on academic records, extracurricular achievements, essays, recommendations, and financial need. <a href=\"http://connect.denison.edu/portal/DCA\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about applying for the Denison-Columbus Alliance »</a> Through funding from the National Science Foundation, Denison furthers our commitment to assist talented low-income domestic students interested in pursuing majors and careers in STEM fields. The S-STEM (Scholarships for STEM) awards scholarships to qualifying students in STEM fields. In addition, the grant provides funds to adapt and implement curricular and co-curricular activities that support recruitment, retention, student success, and career pathways in STEM. Program highlights: To apply for the S-STEM program, students interesting in pursuing scientific research in Biochemistry, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Earth Science, Environmental Science, and/or Mathematics must submit the Common Application by the deadline date for their respective application round. However, because opportunity is limited, awardees will likely enroll through Denison’s early decision rounds. For more than 20 years, talented high school sophomores and juniors have participated in the acclaimed <a href=\"https://reynolds.denison.edu/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Reynolds Young Writers Workshop</a> at Denison. Nearly 50 students spend a week in June at this residential program, immersed in writing workshops and one-on-one interactions with professional writers. High school sophomores and juniors are invited to apply for admission to the program. The application includes a creative writing sample, a recommendation form, and a $25 application fee. The program fee includes tuition, housing, and meals, and financial assistance is available—based on need—through the Reynolds Endowment. Denison is proud to partner with <a href=\"https://sayyestoeducation.org/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Say Yes to Education</a> to offer full tuition—covered by free grant aid—to all admitted students from public schools in Buffalo, NY; Cleveland, OH; Guilford County, NC; and Syracuse, NY. Students who attend public school in these cities and are admitted to Denison will have their full cost of tuition covered with grant aid for all four years. Denison is proud to work with <a href=\"https://www.suttontrust.com/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">The Sutton Trust</a>, a foundation that aims to improve social mobility through education. The Sutton Trust US Programme, run in partnership with the US-UK Fulbright Commission, offers a scholarship program for high school students from the United Kingdom to attend top American colleges and universities. <a href=\"https://us.suttontrust.com/apply/eligibility-and-selection/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">To be eligible to apply</a>, applicants must attend, and have always attended, a state-funded school or college (non-fee paying) in the UK, not hold U.S. citizenship, and be from a low-income family (generally, this will mean a household earning £45,000 or less per year). Students who are selected by The Sutton Trust US Programme, and who are admitted to Denison, will have their full cost of attendance (tuition, housing, and meals) covered with free grant aid for all four years. The U.S. Department of Education established the national <a href=\"https://www2.ed.gov/programs/trioupbound/index.html\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Upward Bound Program</a> as a part of President Johnson’s Great Society initiatives. The program provides fundamental support to participants as they prepare for college, and it serves high school students from low-income families, as well as first-generation students. Denison University offers an Upward Bound Scholarship in the amount of $20,000 each year to qualified program participants who are admitted to Denison. Students in the Upward Bound Program need only submit an application for admission to Denison to be considered for admission (and therefore the scholarship). ",

    "content": "Denison University's angle on deferred enrollment, the process and additional logistics with choosing to take a gap year. When first-year students apply to Denison University for a given term, it is assumed that, if admitted, they will enroll in the term for which they applied. However, under certain circumstances, it may be desirable for students to defer their enrollment at Denison to a future term. Approval for deferred enrollment, also known as a gap year, is guaranteed for applicants who inform the Office of Admission of their intent to defer prior to being admitted. Students can inform the Office of Admission through the enrollment preferences form in their applicant portal. If requests are submitted after being admitted, the Office of Admission will make every effort to accommodate reasonable requests for deferred enrollment. After being offered fall admission to Denison and paying the nonrefundable enrollment deposit,<strong> students seeking deferred enrollment may request a gap year no later than June 1</strong>. Requests must be made in writing by emailing the Office of Admission at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:admission@denison.edu\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">admission@denison.edu</a>. The request must include a clear explanation of why the deferral is being requested and how it is in the student’s best interest. When deciding whether or not to grant a gap year, the admission committee will consider how the student will be spending the time away from college. It should be a period of personal growth and learning beyond the classroom. The admission committee will respond to the student’s request by email, typically within one week. Students may only have their enrollment deferred one time; requests for a second deferment will not be granted. Students who receive approval for deferred enrollment must explicitly reaffirm their intention to enroll and pay an additional deposit. Students approved to defer will be provided portal access where they can reaffirm their intention to enroll and pay the additional deposit. Students who fail to explicitly reaffirm their intention to enroll forfeit their deferred enrollment. For students deferring their enrollment, the dollar value of any institutional merit-based scholarship they received will be maintained, though the name or source of the funds for the scholarship may change. Need-based financial aid, if applicable, will not be maintained automatically from one academic year to the next and may change if there are changes in the student’s financial information. Students must always reapply for need-based financial aid under the policies in effect for the year in which they enroll. Students who defer their enrollment are not permitted to enroll in any credit-bearing courses at another college or university without the prior written approval of the Denison University Office of Admission. Students who enroll in any credit-bearing course without prior written approval of the Denison University Office of Admission forfeit their deferred enrollment and must reapply for admission to Denison. Denison encourages students to pursue transformative gap experiences that will help them grow. We are committed to instilling global perspectives and cross-cultural understanding through meaningful experiences. For example, one immersive gap experience is <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizenyear.org/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=listing&amp;utm_term=denison\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Global Citizen Year</a> — one of the high-quality gap programs that provides scholarships to a majority of selected students. Each semester, Global Citizen Year recruits a diverse corps of talented young people around the world for a gap semester abroad called <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizenyear.org/take-action-lab/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=listing&amp;utm_term=denison\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Take Action Lab</a>. While immersing in a new culture, Take Action Lab students apprentice with experienced changemakers addressing global challenges. Students learn how to tackle global issues from the ground up by working alongside local experts advancing human rights, sustainability, and more. With Take Action Lab, students expand their awareness of both global issues and their own sense of purpose, ultimately fueling a future of positive impact. If you are interested in applying for this opportunity, please consult Global Citizen Year’s <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizenyear.org/admissions/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=listing&amp;utm_term=denison\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">admissions page</a> for application materials and upcoming deadlines. If you indicate on your application that you are also applying to Denison College, Global Citizen Year will prioritize your application and consider you for their available pool of <a href=\"https://www.globalcitizenyear.org/financial-aid-tuition/?utm_source=partner&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=listing&amp;utm_term=denison\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">need-based financial aid and merit scholarships</a>.

At Denison, we know that the collection of transcripts, lists of activities, and essays are just the beginning in understanding who our applicants are as students, leaders, and people. Our applicants are so much more dynamic than what we often see on a computer screen, and we’d love the opportunity to get to know the real you. <strong>An interview is not required for admission consideration, but we do encourage applicants to complete one</strong>—as they often benefit students far beyond simply supplementing an application. Admission interviews provide prospective students the opportunity to connect with our community, to learn more about Denison, and to get your questions answered. We encourage you to consider one of our interview options below: It is just that—a conversation with someone genuinely interested in you and what you have to say. No need to stress about it. Your interviewer wants the conversation to go well, too! Just think of this as yet another way to learn about Denison…and to brag a little bit about yourself. We want to know about the things that make you who you are. Do you read 50 science fiction books a year? Great! Did you complete a project at school that sparked an interest? Tell us about it! Do you spend weekends working at your local animal shelter? Awesome! Do you collect finger puppets of historical figures? Interesting! Still figuring out what you are passionate about, but actively dipping your toes in the water of various interests? Love it! There is no “perfect applicant.” Every Denison student is unique, with various interests, strengths, and goals. Don’t try to fit yourself into an idea of what you think we are looking for—just be you! Interviews are a time for you to get to know Denison better as well, and by asking questions you are showing us you are interested in us. No questions are stupid questions, and if your interviewer doesn’t know the answer, they will follow up with you after asking an expert. Interviews are not required, but strongly recommended. Most successful applicants choose to sit for an interview. The most important thing to know is that this isn’t a test. We aren’t going to ask you questions that require preparation. We have your transcripts to see how well you do in school. In that sense, you do not need to prepare specific information. What we do recommend is coming ready to interview us as well. This is meant to be a two-way conversation, and we hope that you learn as much about Denison as we learn about you. Think of some questions you would like to hear the answers to, especially questions that can’t be answered by browsing our website. For virtual interviews, you may need to do a bit of preparation. We recommend testing the interview link, camera, and microphone (we want to see and hear you!), making sure you have a good stable wifi connection, and setting yourself up in a space where you won’t be interrupted for about 30 minutes. We begin interviewing prospective first-year students as early as the spring of their junior year, and interviews must be completed by our Regular Decision deadline of January 15 of a student’s senior year. Prospective transfer students are also welcome to interview, and should interview before their application deadline - either November 15 or April 15. Don’t wait until the last minute to sign up – if you plan to apply to Denison, we recommend sitting for an interview early in the process. We do not have a standardized set of questions; all of our interviewers will ask different questions. In fact, we would prefer to have a more open conversation. Our goal in an interview is to get to know you outside of what you are able to share in your application. Relationships are critical at Denison, and this is an opportunity for us to start a relationship with you at Denison. There is no formal dress requirement. Dress comfortably, but appropriately. We are far more interested in what you have to say than what you decide to wear. You will be given the same consideration in the admission process regardless of who interviews you. But that doesn’t mean you might not have a preference. Alumni are great resources to help you understand the spirit of Denison. Absolutely not. At Denison, an interview is an interview. We are happy to have a conversation with you in whatever form best suits you! While optional, interviews are evaluative, so they are considered a part of your application to Denison. The admission officers who read your application will have the interview notes available to them as part of that review, and they will read those notes alongside the rest of your application. This is why it’s important for us to learn things about you in the interview that aren’t as prominent in your application. Throughout the application, our goal is to understand if you are academically prepared for Denison, and to understand what you will contribute to our residential community inside and outside of the classroom. Look, we would love to chat all day. Unfortunately, with over 9,000 applications, unless we learn how to self-multiply, that’s just not feasible, so everyone is limited to one interview. We do ask that you turn your video on during virtual interviews. We would have loved to meet in person, and we want this experience to come as close to an in-person interview as possible. There’s no need to do a Denison interview if you’re planning to submit an InitialView or Vericant Interview. The one advantage of a Denison interview is that you’ll be able to ask us questions about our campus community. ",

Thoughts, musings, and wisdom from Denison’s Admission staff We often refer to each other as “the other side of the desk.” But I don’t think that mindset really describes what we hope to accomplish in conjunction with you. In an ideal world, college counselors and admission staff are both working on the same project, with the same goal, from different angles. We hope this corner of our website will make your part of the project easier as you work with students who may be right for Denison. We know that some of our greatest assets are the relationships we foster with school communities around the world—and we are here to answer any questions you may have or to provide any assistance we can to make sure those relationships stay strong.

I am also happy to work with you regardless of where you are located. If we can be of any help – if you want to have an honest conversation about a prospective student, if you want an expert to talk on a panel, or anything else at all – please don’t hesitate to reach out. <strong><em>- Gregory Sneed, Vice President for Enrollment Management</em></strong> Denison takes a holistic approach to application review, meaning that we consider a broad range of factors when determining who we invite to join our campus community. Demonstrated interest is tracked in a variety of ways because we understand that not all students will have the opportunity or resources to visit our campus. This year, in particular, we are taking a broad approach to evaluating how interested a student is in Denison. Of course, the best way to indicate interest is by applying through our binding Early Decision plan. Applying to Denison Early Decision is a serious commitment, and it’s one that we don’t take lightly, which is why these students have a distinct advantage in the admission process. We also understand that it’s difficult for some families to make that commitment without knowing exactly what the financial situation will look like. If you are working with a student who is considering applying Early Decision but is being held back due to financial uncertainty, please reach out to us, and we will do our best to provide a preview of that student’s financial aid so they can enter into the ED agreement confidently. <strong>Additionally, keep in mind that Denison meets 100% of demonstrated financial need.</strong> <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"edeb1a81-3367-42c8-a330-7cb2ffa451de\" href=\"/campus/admission/dialogue-with-denison\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Dialogue with Denison: Diversity Fly-In »</a> <strong><a href=\"/campus/career\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Ready to Impress</a></strong>&nbsp;– At Denison, career preparation and exploration is central to the experience. The Austin E. Knowlton Center for Career Exploration is among the most robust and forward-thinking career centers in the country. That’s why we have 16 career counselors, double or triple that of most of our peers. Additionally, our Knowlton Center offers career preparation beyond the typical résumé writing, internships, and career counseling seen everywhere—our state-of-the-art programs work to build relevant skill sets and experience needed in the modern-day workplace. And Denison Edge’s new location in downtown Columbus will provide further career-prep resources. The proof is in the results: 96% of recent graduates are working in their desired field or position. <strong><a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"40ddb1ab-d36a-4645-a334-3c125eb2f84d\" href=\"/academics\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">A Pragmatic Approach to the Liberal Arts</a></strong>&nbsp;– We are constantly searching for ways to adapt our educational experience for the 21st century, with the goal of preparing students with the skills, knowledge, and connections they’ll need to be successful after graduation.

We encourage you to use Slate.org throughout the application cycle. A resource free to high school counselors, Slate.org allows counselors to see students’ application statuses. You also have the ability to upload documents, such as transcripts and letters of recommendation, directly into students’ applications. Once admission decisions have been released, you will be able to view them at Slate.org. Many of the hundreds of Slate partner colleges utilize Slate.org to help keep counselors informed about their students’ applications.
