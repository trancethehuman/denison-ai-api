    "content": "Denison is launching an innovative performing arts camp tailored to high school students who want specialized training in their field and exposure to other creative outlets. The <a href=\"https://summertutti.denison.edu/\" class=\"external-link\">inaugural Summer TUTTI program</a>, which runs from June 24 to July 1, 2023, will offer instruction from professional artists and ensembles in dance, theater, and music — for both instrumentalists and composers. Students will not only improve their skills in their discipline of choice, but also collaborate with other performing artists for a uniquely immersive experience. <a href=\"https://summertutti.denison.edu/how-to-apply/\" class=\"external-link\">Applications are now open</a>&nbsp;for the&nbsp;2023 session. “There are many different arts and music camps around the country in the summer,” said Ching-chu Hu, professor of music and director of music theater at Denison. “But at the ones I’ve attended, you mostly stay in your own lane and perform in your own disciplines. We want this to be more collaborative. We want students to lift up their heads a little bit and see what’s going on around them in the other art forms and see how that affects what they want to do.” The summer high school camp is made possible in part by the <a href=\"https://oac.ohio.gov/\" class=\"external-link\">Ohio Arts Council’s</a> ArtsNEXT grant for experimental projects. The nearly $13,000 grant will help support outside artistic and educational personnel, and the program will be eligible for a four-year sustainability grant from the Ohio Arts Council as early as 2024. Summer TUTTI is an extension of Denison’s popular <a href=\"/series/tutti\">TUTTI Festival</a>, a visiting artists series held every two years on campus. TUTTI is a musical term taken from the Italian for “all together.” Hu founded the TUTTI Festival as a way to create connections across multiple disciplines, and what began as a two-day music event blossomed into a weeklong performing arts showcase. Margot Singer, director of the Michael D. Eisner Center for the Performing Arts, hopes the high school campers will join in that spirit of discovery and connection. “The students will focus on their disciplines very intensely in the mornings,” she said. “But in the afternoon, they’ll mix it up, get out of their comfort zones, and try things together.” Denison prides itself on being a college where students can experience performing arts training on par with top conservatories while also receiving a life-shaping liberal arts education — and this approach was part of the discussion when Singer, Hu and others began to envision Summer TUTTI more than two years ago. “We wanted to give students a chance to enrich their summer experience and their own talents, but at the same time show them a peek at what college life could be like at Denison,” Hu said. Summer TUTTI is the latest example of Denison’s deepening commitment to the arts, Singer said, and will serve as a recruiting tool for the university, helping build a diverse pipeline of students to Denison. “We want kids to go back to their high schools and say, ‘Wow, I really had a fun week at Denison — amazing program, fantastic teachers,’” she said. Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023. Five recent graduates helped to secure the prestigious designation — the fifth time in six years Denison has been named a Top Producer.",

His residency next year will give our students an unparalleled opportunity to learn from an acclaimed poet and critic whose incisive cultural commentary is vital to our present moment.” The Nowik Writer-in-Residence program was established through the generosity of Denison Alumni Council Trustee Kathryn Correia ’79 and Stephen Correia to bring top poets, writers, literary scholars, and critics to campus. Abdurraqib is the second recipient, following Pulitzer Prize winner Connie Schultz. His residency will begin in the fall of 2023. Abdurraqib — whose books include <em>They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us, Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest</em>, and <em>A Little Devil in America</em>, which received 2022 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction — will teach two weeklong master classes each semester of his residency, expanding a relationship with Denison that includes appearances as part of the university’s <a href=\"/series/beck\">Beck Series</a> and the summertime <a href=\"https://reynolds.denison.edu/\" class=\"external-link\">Reynolds Young Writers Workshop</a>. “I have enjoyed the time I have spent at Denison in recent years, working with young writers and building relationships with undergraduate writers as well,” Abdurraqib said. “My hope is that my presence on campus will continue to enhance that exchange and build relationships that further strengthen the already vibrant community of writers who call Ohio home.” The Columbus, Ohio, native released his first full-length poetry collection, <em>The Crown Ain’t Worth Much</em>, in June 2016 and was a finalist for the Eric Hoffer Book Prize. In the winter of the following year, his first collection of essays, <em>They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us</em>, met with wide acclaim and was named a book of the year by outlets including <em>Esquire</em>, NPR, Pitchfork, and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. In 2019 he released <em>Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest</em>, which became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, followed later that year by his second collection of poems, <em>A Fortune for Your Disaster</em>. His 2021 essay collection, <em>A Little Devil in America</em>, was a finalist for the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. That same year, Abdurraqib was awarded a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship, sometimes called a “Genius Grant.” “He would have every reason to be full of himself, and it’s just the absolute opposite — he’s so approachable, so generous, so humble,” said author Margot Singer, director of creative writing at Denison and the former director of the Reynolds Workshop, a writing program for high school students. “He relates to students in a way that’s so uniquely Hanif. He has come to Reynolds several times, and the students are just rapt.” Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023.

    "content": "Rachel Jankowski ’22 learned to surmount academic and life challenges while at Denison. Those same skills have been helping her in Poland, where she is conducting environmental science research as a 2022-23 Fulbright student. Jankowski is one of five recent Denison graduates who were offered prestigious Fulbright U.S. Student grants for the 2022-2023 academic year — a total that once again secured Denison’s place as a Fulbright Top Producing Institution. The program announced its list on Friday, Feb. 10. Denison has been named a Top Producer for five of the last six years. Other Denison award recipients who helped the college earn the designation are Hannah Gilson ’22, who is on an English teaching assistantship in Bulgaria; Cynthia Guerrero ’22, on an English teaching assistantship in Peru; Sarah Schubert ’21, on an English teaching assistantship in Mexico; and Michael Ball ’22, who was awarded an English teaching assistantship in Uzbekistan but declined to pursue another opportunity. Funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Fulbright grants build international bridges through education. Awardees spend a post-graduate academic year teaching English, conducting research, or studying at a university in one of over 140 participating countries. Fulbright grants are awarded based on academic and professional achievement, as well as applicants’ records of service and leadership potential in their respective fields. Denison prepares its students to thrive as Fulbright awardees through the college’s rigorous academics, significant research and internship opportunities, and strong faculty mentorship philosophy, says Adam Davis, a history professor and the director of Denison’s Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement. “That Denison once again has been named a top producer of Fulbright awards underscores what we already know — a Denison education equips its students with challenging and rewarding academic experiences, invaluable life skills, and the confidence and dexterity required to navigate an increasingly globalized and complex world,” Davis says. “These Fulbright awards are a testament to our students’ deep global engagement, intellectual curiosity, and commitment to building intercultural understanding.” That’s been precisely the experience for Jankowski. Rachel Jankowski ’22 “I am really loving my Fulbright term in Poland,” she says. “It is improving my worldview and my self-awareness. Almost everything is a challenge, but that is how I know I am growing and learning. “My four years at Denison were similar in this regard — academically challenging — and I gained an appreciation for active, holistic learning through struggle,” Jankowski says. “Denison fostered my sense of curiosity, and my professors helped me build confidence. I am always developing these skills, but I use them every day while studying and living in Poland.” The Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement provides advising and support for students as they prepare their applications for a wide range of international and domestic fellowships. The center is holding Fulbright information sessions on March 23 and 27. Interested students or recent alums can email the center for information and to register. The Fulbright Program was created to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. Fulbright is the world’s largest and most diverse international educational exchange program. Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023. Appointment to international organization is a natural progression for associate professor of economics Fadhel Kaboub ",

At the ceremony, Malloch-Brown also will be recognized with the conferring of an honorary degree, Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa. “We celebrate Lord Mark Malloch-Brown as a pragmatic and passionate advocate of human rights and as a global change agent dedicated to improving the lives of millions of people,” says Denison President Adam Weinberg. “Mark exemplifies the strengths of the liberal arts to engage in critical thinking and intellectual humility while examining the complex issues of our time.” Malloch-Brown has worked to advance human rights, justice, and development for more than four decades in a variety of roles: with the United Nations, the World Bank, and as a British government minister, as well as with a range of civil society groups and businesses. His distinguished career in international affairs includes service as deputy secretary general of the United Nations under Kofi Annan, heading the United Nations Development Programme, directing external affairs at the World Bank, and working as a British government minister. Malloch-Brown served the British government as Minister of State for Africa and the United Nations at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office under Prime Minister Gordon Brown. He spearheaded the global promotion of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals as head of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) from 1999 to 2005 under then-U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. At the UNDP and previously as head of external affairs at the World Bank, Malloch-Brown led reform efforts that were widely seen as increasing the impact of both organizations. He later served as Annan’s chief of staff before his appointment as U.N. Deputy Secretary General. Knighted for his contribution to international affairs, Malloch-Brown is currently on leave from the British House of Lords. As president of Open Society Foundations, the world’s largest private funder of independent groups working for justice, democratic governance, and human rights, he oversees the foundation’s work in more than 120 countries around the world. “Global challenges require persistent and creative leadership,” says Malloch-Brown. “Graduates from liberal arts institutions such as Denison can examine and disentangle systems to advocate for the kind of holistic solutions we need. I am looking forward to this opportunity to engage with future leaders.” A Distinguished Practitioner at Oxford University’s Blavatnik School of Government, Malloch-Brown is an adjunct fellow at Chatham House’s Queen Elizabeth Program and has been a visiting distinguished fellow at the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization.

    "content": "As associate professor of economics, Zarrina Juraqulova discovered at a young age it is just as much about us, the opportunities we are given, and the choices we make. Juraqulova earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in economics in her native Tajikistan and spent the next decade working there for organizations including the United Nations, Winrock International, and World Bank. Her pursuit of a Ph.D. brought her to the United States, specifically to Washington State University. She discovered Denison as a visiting professor in 2015 and quickly saw the merits of a liberal arts approach to education. Her two oldest children are now Denison students, and she loves that they are encouraged to see the world around them from all angles. “They can challenge themselves in terms of their religion, their ideology, their political standing,” she said. “Being in the liberal arts provides them with the opportunity to learn across all disciplines.” “I am very happy being in academia, because in academia it is constant learning,” she said. “You’re always learning something new.” <strong>You grew up in Tajikistan and witnessed the implosion of the Soviet Union as a child. How did that experience pique your interest in economics?</strong> I was 12 years old when the Soviet Union collapsed, and I clearly remember the frustrations that many people had. They lost jobs, they lost money, they lost their savings. And overnight there was a new economic system. They didn’t know anything about a market economy, or how it functions. People were not ready for those big changes. Seeing all these drastic changes sparked my curiosity to learn more about the economy. <strong>You’ve said the idea of a liberal arts college like Denison was new to you upon arriving in the U.S., but that you found yourself quickly drawn to that style of learning. Why?</strong> I came to Denison as a visiting professor. Coming to Denison, I learned what it means to be a “liberal arts school.” In former Soviet Union countries, we don’t have liberal arts schools. I really like that in liberal arts schools, people appreciate the interdisciplinary approach to research, to the courses. I really like working with students and colleagues from various disciplines. I’m the kind of person who wants to learn about an issue from different perspectives. I think the students appreciate when I share with them my professional experience and bring examples from my personal background. I worked as a volunteer for the United Nations Development Program to help implement rehabilitation projects in a war-affected area of Tajikistan. This experience opened the door to many professional career opportunities for me at other international humanitarian agencies based in Tajikistan. I have been fortunate to be part of programs that aimed to enhance local governance, ensure sustainable local economic growth, and strengthen livelihoods and employable skills for rural populations with high levels of poverty. It was a good experience because I obtained real-life/empirical knowledge by working with different people in the community. <strong>You see economics through a human lens. You are on sabbatical this semester to further your research on the economic impact of reproductive rights in Central Asia, as well as child care issues in Kazakhstan. Why is it important to view economics in the context of social issues like child care and elder care, income disparity, gender politics, and diversity?</strong> Economics is not all about finance, money, interest rates, or stock markets. Economics can also be used to study different issues, such as gender inequality and how it affects the economy. Economics is about people, their behaviors, and how their decisions also affect their future perspectives or their productivity. Our behaviors and choices affect our well-being and financial independence. <strong>You recently started growing roses as a hobby. How did that come about, and what does it say about you?</strong> I’m the kind of person who likes changes, but good changes, intellectual changes. Last year I started growing roses as a fun activity. It’s not easy to grow roses in Ohio because of the humidity. In Tajikistan, when we grow roses it is much easier. It doesn’t require so much care. Here it takes a lot of care, so I am learning how to effectively take care of them. That is just how I am. I’m constantly trying to learn something new, and move forward. ",

    "content": "Denison students are learning how Cowans, Eli Reed, and their legendary mentor Gordon Parks helped alter perception about the medium through their prolific and trailblazing work. <a href=\"/places/museum\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">The Denison Museum</a> is hosting the exhibit <em><a href=\"/events/event/148623\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Gordon Parks &amp; Contemporaries: Through the Lens</a></em> through March 29, 2023. More than 50 classes are expected to walk through the gallery, with its emphasis on the Black American experience, before the end of the spring semester. Students can examine arresting images of historic events, everyday life, and foreign wars, as well celebrity portraits of Muhammad Ali, Louis Armstrong, Tupac Shakur, Biggie Smalls, and others. “This is a teaching museum,” said Megan Hancock, senior curator of education and exhibitions at the Denison Museum. “We can take themes in this exhibit and connect across different disciplines. We can use the pictures from these brilliant photographers as vehicles for discussion on history, race, economics, and many other subjects.” Both Cowans and Reed are proteges of Parks, who died in 2006 at age 93. Parks was an artist of prodigious talents, many self-taught, that included photography, narrative writing, poetry, musical composition, and filmmaking. “Gordon was not just a great artist, he was cool,” Reed said. “He was like a black James Bond.” Associate professor Sheilah ReStack, chair of Studio Art, said that while students sometimes understand themselves in relation to the “present moment,” the Parks exhibit affords them the opportunity to gain historical context. As a photography instructor, ReStack also mentions the importance of gaining trust and building relationships with subjects. Parks did it with a Harlem gang leader he profiled for <em>Life</em>, and Reed did the same on overseas assignments that sometimes required him to wear bulletproof vests in war-torn regions. Cowans hopes students recognize the role Parks played in the medium’s development, particularly in exploring themes of social justice. Reed, who twice was abducted while covering the civil war in Lebanon (1975-1990), wants students to ask themselves questions as they tour the gallery. “What do you believe in? What do you hope for? What do you want to say before you leave the planet?” Reed asked rhetorically. “Maybe you can change the world. You don’t know. But if you don’t try, you will never find out.” <em>The exhibit is sponsored in part by the Vail Series. Work is courtesy of Adger Cowans, Eli Reed, and the Gordon Parks Museum in Fort Scott, Kansas.</em> ",

    "content": "Free speech on college campus has emerged as a new front in the culture wars. But despite what you may have heard, most university students and faculty are supportive of free speech and the robust exchange of ideas on university campuses. According to recent research by the Knight Foundation, 84 percent of students view free speech rights as critical to our democracy. Still, college campuses are increasingly challenging places to have challenging conversations. The same study found that the percentage of students who believe that free speech rights are secure has dropped from 59 percent to 47 percent since 2019—fully 12 points. Meanwhile, the percentage of students who felt their campus climate prevents students from expressing their opinions has increased, from 54 percent to 65 percent, since 2016. Universities need to do more to protect free inquiry and expression, which will only flourish on campuses that are clear about their purpose, driven by cultures of curiosity and intellectual humility, hold the line when controversies arise, and focus on creating communities where everybody feels a sense of connection. How do we do this kind of work? Universities can start by laying out clearly and loudly our purpose and articulating why free inquiry and expression of ideas are crucial to our work. This should be simple: Colleges and universities exist to produce knowledge and educate students. Neither of these is possible if faculty feel a need to censor themselves and students don’t have the opportunity to voice their views, hear the views of others and engage across intellectual differences. To this end, at Denison, the university where I am the president, our faculty wrote an <a href=\"https://catalog.denison.edu/catalog/history-mission-values/expression-academic-freedom/\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external-link\">academic freedom policy</a> that is publicly available on our website and included in the student handbook. The policy outlines the importance of free expression to the mission of the university and the role of students and faculty in promoting intellectual inquiry and scholarly engagement. The policy is direct: “Academic Freedom is the right of all members of the University to exercise the broadest possible latitude in speaking, writing, listening, challenging, and learning.” It goes on, “Academic freedom applies to views and ideas that most members of the University may consider mistaken, dangerous, and even despicable.” It’s not just enough to state it, though; we need to build these messages into how we onboard everybody on our campus. That means talking explicitly about why free inquiry and expression of ideas are important in new student and parent orientation programs, as well as onboarding new faculty and staff. Beyond messaging, we also need to focus on skills—skills students are not showing up on university campuses with. This year, we used new student orientation to host a <a href=\"/magazine/winter-2023/148750\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">parliamentary-style debate</a> on free speech to help students start to develop the basic skills to do this work. Our faculty have organized a speaker series called Minds Wide Open that is designed to generate opportunities for students to embrace discomfort as normal, fun and important. The same kind of work needs to be done in classrooms. There is an art to engaging in open, fierce, and productive intellectual inquiry. Many faculty are already helping students learn to frame questions in ways that open room for inquiry rather than shutting it down, listen closely to what others can teach us, and engage effectively across intellectual differences. But colleges could do more, especially with new faculty, to ensure they have the tools to effectively generate and manage challenging classroom conversations. As part of this work, universities also need to hold ourselves accountable to make sure students are hearing a wide range of views and perspectives in their courses and across campus programs and events. Despite all the groundwork, controversies will arise. When they do, the message to campus should be simple: We welcome the expression of ideas and the debate that it generates. This is a normal and important part of a university campus. We encourage everybody to listen to the arguments being made, ask hard questions, raise competing data, and see this as part of the process of how we produce knowledge and educate each other. And we must accept that there will be tensions. The purpose of a university is not to shield students from ideas, nor is this possible in a world where all views are available to students on their phones. The role of a university is to help students develop curiosity so they can become critical thinkers, creative problem solvers, and effective communicators with the intellectual humility needed to architect their lives and contribute to society. This means protecting faculty when issues arise in classrooms and with invited speakers. If universities don’t stand by their faculty, it is impossible for them to do their jobs effectively. The same is true with students when they make comments that others find objectionable. But this only works if we acknowledge that there is a tension between free expression and inclusion. Most of the concerns of students and faculty are not about free speech but rather about their peers, who are made to feel unwelcome on campus. Getting this right requires a relentless focus on connections, relationships and belonging. The more every member of a community feels valued, connected to each other and interested in learning from each other, the more free speech is valued, even when it is distasteful and challenging. All of this is hard. But the moment universities abdicate their responsibility to create a space where questions can be raised and ideas can flourish, we cease to be the engines of knowledge and education that society depends on to advance. Everything from well-informed public policy to the next great scientific breakthrough to well-run companies and organizations depends upon it. President Weinberg outlines the initial impacts of COVID-19 to Denison over the next two years. President Weinberg discussed the ‘Future of Higher Ed’ in a new podcast with author Jeff Selingo President Weinberg: Students need to develop a range of attributes—from creativity, ethics and intuition to analytical, quantitative and logic skills.

    "content": "A software engineer and 15-year veteran in the gaming industry, Lewis shares his knowledge with Denison students as a mentor and guest speaker in Professor Ashwin Lall’s popular Game Design course. “I’m a little jealous that a class like this wasn’t around when I was at Denison,” said Lewis, a dual major in computer science and physics who works for Crystal Dynamics, a California-based video game developer. It’s not just because students learn the technology that powers a video game industry that generates more than $180 billion in revenue annually. In fact, producing the next generation of game designers isn’t the primary objective of Lall’s class. While students in Lall’s class learn the rudimentary skills of game design, they’re also expected to work in groups, collaborate with others outside the computer programming bubble, and engage in the delicate art of constructive criticism. “This class mirrors the world of game design and programming,” said Lewis, the software engineer. “There’s tons of cross-disciplinary work in it. Teamwork is essential.” Lall joined the Denison faculty in 2010 and within two years received the department’s blessing to teach Game Design as an elective. The course, which isn’t offered every year, is in high demand and is capped at 18 students. In the spring of 2019, Lall didn’t want to disappoint students who had waited their turn to take Game Design, so he taught it while on sabbatical. Almost every game created in class is linked on Lall’s personal website. Game Design is available only to computer science majors who have taken lower-level courses that prepare them for the technical challenges. In those classes, they learn multiple programming languages, including Python and C++. The goal, Lall said, is for students to become proficient problem solvers,” at which point they can delve into new languages with relative ease. Twice a semester, class members publicly debut their product at showcases — exhibitions that allow faculty, staff, and fellow students to play their web-based games in Slayter Hall. Game design veteran and class mentor Spencer Brooks ’97, who was a geology and cinema dual major at Denison, loves this component of what he calls the “perfect liberal arts course.” “I tell the class all the time that if you aren’t easy to work with, you are going to get fired,” Brooks said. “A huge part of game design is giving and taking feedback.” In the spirit of connection and the desire to improve the games’ aesthetic and narrative qualities, Lall lobbied the English and Music departments in 2015 for collaborators. The writers and composers meet with the designers to listen to their visions for the games before going to work. From the beginning, Lall had students working in groups for weeks at a time, which isn’t the norm in most computer science classes. Midway through the term, groups are reshuffled, giving students the opportunity to work with different teammates. “Nobody does this alone,” said Mary Price ’23. “You really rely on your partners, because we build these games outside of the class and do it in face-to-face settings.” These collaborations sometimes produce creative differences, but they can teach the value of working toward an end goal. Zuoyu Wang ’23 recalls asking his composer to take another crack at the musical score, and watching as the second version earned praise from those who played the game at the mid-term showcase. “That falls into the category of having hard conversations,” Provost Kim Coplin said. “That’s not easy to do for a lot of people, and I think it’s a good experience for our students.” Lall recently added another layer of collaboration to his class. Final projects now require teams to partner with campus departments that act as clients. For example, students who designed Malware Blaster consulted with Information Technologies for a game that highlights the dangers of malicious software. “I just love the cross-campus collaboration,” Coplin said. “Classes like this bring teams together who have different fields of expertise. It’s a great example of what we do here.” ",

    "content": "As she spoke, fellow Denison students, some lugging instruments, whisked past her on the way to rehearsals and classes in the Michael D. Eisner Center for Performing Arts. Pham relished being back in the environment, preparing to work through a movement-and-voice piece with partner William Nguyen ’25. The senior might have missed this opportunity had she not attended a spring 2022 showing of HERE US, a Denison Theatre Department production by students of color who create original content through spoken word, music, dance, and digital arts. Sitting in the crowd that night at Sharon Martin Hall, Pham was enchanted. Pham sang in high school musicals growing up in Hanoi, Vietnam, but after coming to Denison she was focused on her studies as a philosophy and communications double major. She hadn’t realized a platform like HERE US existed, or that only one member of its current cast is a theatre major. Pham is now one of them. Her piece with Nguyen is among the 15 that have been woven together for the <a href=\"/events/event/146829\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">HERE US shows at Sharon Martin Hall on Feb. 23-25, 2023</a>. “I wanted to give it a try,” she said. “It’s nice to see other people like me, who aren’t majoring or minoring in the performing arts, having an open space to explore our passions.” “Everything was word of mouth,” said Simpson, a double major in psychology and cinema. “When we met someone, we tried to be persistent. It was like, ‘We have an idea, we have a vision, we have a team to back us up – trust me.’” Simpson met theatre professor James Dennen in 2019 at a Black Student Union meeting where he was soliciting performers and other artists for an unrelated production. Simpson, who started performing slam poetry in her native Chicago, showed an interest in Dennen’s project but also voiced concerns about a related issue. She mentioned the need for a creative outlet for minority students who weren’t enmeshed in the performing arts — a space for artistic expression. “I asked Jim if there was any way we could address this,” Simpson said. They brainstormed ideas and began collaborating to make HERE US a reality. Dennen lobbied faculty and staff, reserved rehearsal and performance space, and secured lab credit hours for participants who worked on stage and behind the scenes. Simpson assembled founding members that included Sky Calderón ’21 and Cordero Estremera ’23. The following year, they added Khushi Mohapatra ’24, who serves as the stage manager. “We went from always wanting to be in that space to making that space for ourselves,” said Estremera ’23, a creative writing-philosophy double major. “We took the initiative.” The original HERE US members spent months workshopping ideas, writing scripts, and rehearsing and revising pieces based on suggestions from faculty members. Just as they prepared for their 2020 debut production, the global pandemic forced the cancelation of in-person classes and activities. “I really wasn’t sure we would be able to keep it together,” Calderón said. “But there was so much determination to make it happen.” The group stayed active through video conferences, and when students returned in fall 2020, HERE US staged a virtual production. The first live performance followed in spring 2022 with three nights at Martin Hall that included 14 pieces — one entitled <em>Sincerely, Your Fairy Godmother</em>. “It was quite literally one of the best experiences of my life,” Simpson said. “I still get people who come up and say, ‘You are the Fairy Godmother,’ and I say, ‘Yes, I am.’” As the theatrical production expands and evolves, new student leadership is required. Simpson and Estremera are about to take their final bows, and replacements will need to motivate and shepherd members through long hours of developing their stories, rehearsing pieces and meeting deadlines over the course of a school year. Dennen believes younger students will rise to the challenge, and new talent will emerge. More faculty are becoming engaged as well. This year, Associate Professor of Dance Ojeya Cruz Banks assisted in the production. “There’s a real appetite for the work,” he said. “We’re working to make people see that what we are doing is totally accessible to them. That’s how we are trying to build this program.” ",

    "content": "Rachel Jankowski ’22 learned to surmount academic and life challenges while at Denison. Those same skills have been helping her in Poland, where she is conducting environmental science research as a 2022-23 Fulbright student. Jankowski is one of five recent Denison graduates who were offered prestigious Fulbright U.S. Student grants for the 2022-2023 academic year — a total that once again secured Denison’s place as a Fulbright Top Producing Institution. The program announced its list on Friday, Feb. 10. Denison has been named a Top Producer for five of the last six years. Other Denison award recipients who helped the college earn the designation are Hannah Gilson ’22, who is on an English teaching assistantship in Bulgaria; Cynthia Guerrero ’22, on an English teaching assistantship in Peru; Sarah Schubert ’21, on an English teaching assistantship in Mexico; and Michael Ball ’22, who was awarded an English teaching assistantship in Uzbekistan but declined to pursue another opportunity. Funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs, Fulbright grants build international bridges through education. Awardees spend a post-graduate academic year teaching English, conducting research, or studying at a university in one of over 140 participating countries. Fulbright grants are awarded based on academic and professional achievement, as well as applicants’ records of service and leadership potential in their respective fields. Denison prepares its students to thrive as Fulbright awardees through the college’s rigorous academics, significant research and internship opportunities, and strong faculty mentorship philosophy, says Adam Davis, a history professor and the director of Denison’s Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement. “That Denison once again has been named a top producer of Fulbright awards underscores what we already know — a Denison education equips its students with challenging and rewarding academic experiences, invaluable life skills, and the confidence and dexterity required to navigate an increasingly globalized and complex world,” Davis says. “These Fulbright awards are a testament to our students’ deep global engagement, intellectual curiosity, and commitment to building intercultural understanding.” That’s been precisely the experience for Jankowski. Rachel Jankowski ’22 “I am really loving my Fulbright term in Poland,” she says. “It is improving my worldview and my self-awareness. Almost everything is a challenge, but that is how I know I am growing and learning. “My four years at Denison were similar in this regard — academically challenging — and I gained an appreciation for active, holistic learning through struggle,” Jankowski says. “Denison fostered my sense of curiosity, and my professors helped me build confidence. I am always developing these skills, but I use them every day while studying and living in Poland.” The Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement provides advising and support for students as they prepare their applications for a wide range of international and domestic fellowships. The center is holding Fulbright information sessions on March 23 and 27. Interested students or recent alums can email the center for information and to register. The Fulbright Program was created to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. Fulbright is the world’s largest and most diverse international educational exchange program. Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023. Appointment to international organization is a natural progression for associate professor of economics Fadhel Kaboub ",

    "content": "Fadhel Kaboub Fadhel Kaboub, associate professor of economics, advises his students that knowledge should not be confined to the classroom but shared with the world. It’s a philosophy that has led him to the Horn of Africa. Kaboub has been granted a two-year leave from Denison and has relocated to Ethiopia to serve a key role in the Organisation of Educational Cooperation (OEC), which is headquartered in Addis Ababa. The OEC was founded two years ago to improve the lives of citizens in Latin American, Caribbean, African, Asian, Middle Eastern and Pacific Island countries. The OEC charter states that its purpose is to “contribute to the equitable, just, and prosperous social transformation of societies by promoting balanced and inclusive education, in order to attain the fundamental rights to liberty, justice, dignity, sustainability, social cohesion, and material and immaterial security for the peoples of the world.” A decidedly big goal, but one Kaboub has been working toward for decades, both through his teaching and his research. “I am honored and humbled by the Secretary-General’s appointment to join the Organisation of Educational Cooperation as Under-Secretary-General for Financing for Development,” Kaboub said, “and I am grateful for the opportunity to serve in an organisation that works with member-states towards reducing the Global South’s external debt, securing sustainable financing mechanisms, and creating the fiscal policy space to promote the endogenous economic development needed to achieve the goals of the Universal Declaration of Balanced and Inclusive Education and to meet the aspirations of young people from across the Global South.” Denison Provost Kim Coplin ’85 said Kaboub’s new post meshes perfectly with his philosophy that knowledge should not be siloed at educational institutions but shared far more widely, especially with those who would benefit most from it. In class, Coplin said, “Fadhel was always trying to connect what he was teaching to the real world.” Denison students find Kaboub to be passionate and intentional in his teaching, she said. He’s often encouraged them to write letters to the editor to the esteemed Financial Times of London, as a way to remind them that there is a global audience for the ideas they explored in class. Kaboub began teaching at Denison in 2008. Much of his research builds upon Modern Money Theory and focuses on monetary sovereignty, job creation programs, youth unemployment, and the political economy of the Middle East. He has held several research affiliations, including the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, the Economic Research Forum (Cairo), Power Shift Africa (Nairobi), and the Center for Strategic Studies on the Maghreb (Tunis). Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023. Five recent graduates helped to secure the prestigious designation — the fifth time in six years Denison has been named a Top Producer. ",

    "content": "Abby Valentine ’21 knew none of that when she first chose the oil-on-panel painting from about 100 student works hanging in the Bryant Arts Center on Jan. 27, 2023. She was drawn to the mountain scene and its palette of verdant greens. Now Metzger’s plein air rendering of the oft-painted limestone escarpment of Montagne Sainte-Victoire, the same massif immortalized by French impressionist Paul Cezanne, hangs in the Office of First-Year Experience, where Valentine is an assistant director. 2. Metzger’s art finds a new home in the office of Abby Valentine ’21. “Anytime we can get visual arts out in the world, let’s do it,” says associate professor Sheilah ReStack, who chairs the studio art department. “We have all this student work. This program is a way to allow it to interact with a larger community and viewership.” About 50 student artists were represented in the inaugural one-day event. They provided photographs, collages, pastels, and pastorals. The media and motifs ran the gamut. Some were literally black and white, others kaleidoscopic. “You choose what speaks to you,” she says. What spoke to Patrick Fina, an associate director at the Alford Community Leadership &amp; Involvement Center (CLIC), is a framed poster advertising a past “Take Back the Night” event at Slayter Hall Student Union. The eye-catching poster’s cause fit CLIC’s mission of student involvement, Fina says, and the tie-in to Slayter was a bonus. Leaving Bryant with his one print, he grinned a bit devilishly. “Selfishly,” he said, “I was going to take them all.” Valentine’s appreciation for Metzger’s painting deepened after the two met during the event. He told her of his time abroad, which he describes as “absolutely life-changing in terms of my studio practice.” That strengthened her connection to the painting, she says, because she also had studied abroad in Europe. And now, rather than looking out her office window into the gray of winter, she can turn to Metzger’s painting and be transported to a bright spring day in Europe. ReStack hopes to find a way to connect other participating artists with the borrowers for conversations about the art before the pieces are due back on May 8. “I can’t wait to bring them together,” she says, “and have students understand how their art can communicate and be appreciated in a larger context.” ",

    "content": "Ahead of him was a march to the Mitchell Center to honor the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Behind him were hundreds of fellow Denison students, faculty, and staff following his lead to promote social justice and inclusivity. Some carried signs. Many echoed the words that Tewoldeberhan shouted as the march began. “Just thinking of how much he gave to us, people of color, is very inspiring,” said Tewoldeberhan, the fraternity’s president and treasurer. “This day reminds us of what he fought for, and it gives us the energy to continue his legacy.” “This isn’t a day people should be sitting back and relaxing, but a day when people should be on fire, aspiring to do something great and pushing people to get out of their comfort zone,” said Kwaku Akuffo ’23, president of Denison’s National Pan-Hellenic Council. “I always say that the only way we can learn something is to hear about each other’s experiences and stories.” The service was held in the gospel tradition of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King once preached. Rev. Tim Carpenter, coordinator of Christian Life and director of the gospel choir, was chosen to lead the service after accepting an invitation from campus chaplain Stephanie McLemore. “I said to Stephanie, ‘I’m going to do it the way King would do it,’” Carpenter told the audience in Herrick Hall. “She said, ‘OK.’ So that means each one of you are now Baptists.” Attendance for the various MLK Celebration events and march was robust. The Monday service projects in Slayter drew students who spent the morning making cards for nursing home residents, blankets for hospice patients, and hygiene kits for the homeless. “Looking around and seeing how many people are taking part in these activities is encouraging,” said Diamond McClellan ’25, a minister of affairs for the Black Student Union. The decision to lengthen the march — last year it went from Swasey Chapel to Slayter — and to conclude it at Mitchell was a huge hit. The event culminated in a brunch and an hourlong program that included an appearance from storyteller and poet Dr. Wilson Okello. Akuffo was among the students who addressed the audience in Mitchell. After the march from Slayter, he emphasized the importance of never allowing King’s movement to grow stagnant. “This is my favorite quote from Dr. King,” Akuffo said: “‘If you can’t fly then run. If you can’t run then walk. If you can’t walk then crawl, but whatever you do you have to keep moving forward.’” ",

    "content": "In addition to teaching Earth and environmental sciences to Denison students, Klemetti shares his knowledge about volcanoes and other earth science-related phenomena with readers everywhere through his <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/blog/rocky-planet\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Rocky Planet</a> blog. Since its inception in 2008, several platforms have hosted Rocky Planet (under various names), including Wired — it now has a home with <em>Discover Magazine</em>. The National Association of Geoscience Teachers recently recognized Klemetti for his contributions to scientific writing, naming him the <a href=\"https://nagt.org/nagt/awards/shea/2022_shea.html\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">2022 James E. Shea</a> awardee. He joins fellow honorees and authors Bill McKibben, John McPhee, and Steven Jay Gould, who have made science topics accessible and enjoyable without sacrificing knowledge for readability. “People think they need to be an expert in the field, which is not the case,” Klemetti says. “Science writing is about asking questions to understand what you don’t know — like any good reporter. It’s about explaining and creating a human narrative.” Drawing on his science writing experience, Klemetti has added <a href=\"https://denison.edu/academics/journalism\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">journalism</a> courses to his teaching schedule at Denison. <strong>Science writing: breaking down the complex</strong> Despite the potentially alarming character of his headlines, such as “<a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/planet-earth/major-blast-in-tonga-create-tsunami-and-heavy-ash-fall\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Major Blast in Tonga Creates Tsunami and Heavy Ash Fall</a>,” Klemetti isn’t trying to cause panic. “I’m trying to educate and dispel myths and misinformation.” “Writing about science isn’t anything I intentionally planned to do,” Klemetti says. “But I realized how much people want to understand why these things happen.” Erupting volcanoes are cataclysmic events, but Klemetti finds engaging ways to approach his topic. One of his most-read posts coincided with the release of the final chapter of the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> movie trilogy. It answered the question, “When Gollum falls into the volcano, would he have really just sunk into the lava?” (The short answer: no. Read the full <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2011/12/the-right-and-wrong-way-to-die-when-you-fall-into-lava/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">response</a>, which refers to the specific gravity of people vs. molten rock.) <strong>Why do volcanoes erupt?</strong> Klemetti’s current research, funded by the National Science Foundation, takes place at the Tumalo volcanic center of Bend, Oregon. It’s pertinent to a debate emerging in the field: What exactly is happening inside a volcano before it erupts? “Are volcanoes ready to erupt all the time?” Klemetti asks. “Or are they unable to erupt because they’re mostly sticky, in sort of cold storage? And if that’s true, what triggers a change?” Mapping the inside of a live volcano is out of the question, so Klemetti seeks his answers in the crystals that form in magma as the molten rock cools along the interior walls of a volcano. “This project is super cool,” he says. “We’re filling in a time gap in the Cascade mountain range, looking at the ages of eruptions and how the magma has been stored.” Klemetti completes a circle by bringing his research results back to the classroom. “We teach things we find are interesting, and bring them into our courses in a meaningful way.” ",

    "content": "Lots of colleges provide a high-quality education. Many accept most of their applicants. All decent high school students will have good college options, regardless of whether they get into their top choice. The few dozen or so schools at the top of the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\"><em>U.S. News and World Report</em> rankings</a> do not have a monopoly on providing a quality education. So how do parents and students maximize the outcome? Start by asking the right question: How do we find a college where our child will flourish and be ready to launch quickly and successfully when they graduate? For college to be life-shaping, three things have to happen. First, students need to develop at least one meaningful relationship with a faculty member. Second, they must be engaged in academics and at least one activity such as student government, sports, drama, clubs, or competitions. And third, they need to be surrounded by peers who will bring out the best in them. Prestige tells very little about the likelihood of these three things happening for any prospective applicant. Fit is a much better indicator. How to assess fit? Start by focusing on your child. Have a series of honest conversations about their high school experience. What did they like and dislike? How do they best learn? Are there things they didn’t have a chance to do in high school that they might want to pursue in college? What kinds of people bring out the best in them? What subjects did they enjoy? Where are they in their own personal development? What kind of environment is likely to be the best for them? Most students and families focus on areas of interest that range from a particular academic program to a sport. Of course, these matter. A student with a particular interest should go to a college where it is possible to pursue it. But fit also is determined by the following: There are no right or wrong answers, and universities have different approaches — which is good, because students have different needs and interests. But the answers will help determine the fit. President Weinberg offers steps forward to reframe and begin to solve the “wicked problem” of COVID-19. As Denison heads into the final few weeks of the academic year, President Weinberg provides a few brief updates. Universities need to own their responsibility to create a space where questions can be raised and ideas can flourish. ",

    "content": "Swift was surrounded by Denison faculty, students, and members of the community who had gathered to see his sweeping story of a swath of Appalachian land in southeastern Ohio <a href=\"https://denison.edu/academics/journalism/feature/148256\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">that’s been home to farms, strip mines, and a modern-day wildlife conservation center.</a> Among those in attendance was <a href=\"https://denison.edu/campus/commencement/feature/145573\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Swift’s former student and President’s Medalist Sarah Hume ’22</a>, who worked as a writer and editor on <em>10,000 Acres</em>. “Sarah had driven down from Michigan with her mom,” said Swift, a filmmaker who specializes in documentaries on Ohio subjects. “At some point during the premier, she turned to her mom and said, ‘This is what I want to do.’” Inspiring students to pursue their passion for storytelling is rewarding to Swift, who arrived at Denison in 2017 after teaching at Muskingum University and Ohio University-Zanesville. He teaches and serves as a faculty advisor for <a href=\"https://www.thereportingproject.org/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">The Reporting Project, the university’s non-profit news organization.</a> Praise for <em>10,000 Acres </em>has come at an emotional time for the instructor, whose wife, Michèle, died in early 2022 of cancer. In a wide-ranging interview, Swift spoke of how he became a documentarian, what students with interest in the genre can do to get involved, and why his four-legged friend, Figgy, has been so instrumental in coping with Michèle’s passing. I went to college to study cinematography. I ended up with a minor in it, but I learned the basics. When I became a professor at Muskingum University, where I taught English, creative writing, and journalism, I thought my days of filmmaking were gone. How would I have the money to buy the film, process it, and get an editing table? <strong>So, what changed?</strong> I got tenure at Muskingum, but I needed to quit. I felt too contained. I needed other things to learn and do. So, I did many things. Woodworking, yoga, meditation, and I was the primary caregiver to my son. Then, video was digitized, and I bought a little Canon Sure Shot, started filming my son and making videos, and taught myself digital filmmaking (in the early 2000s). I would just find any subject and make a little documentary about it. My wife, Michèle, was amazingly supportive because we barely had any money. But she supported me as I got nicer cameras and mics and started expanding my repertoire. <strong>Several Denison students contributed to <em>10,000 Acres</em>. If others want to pursue this field, what’s a good way to get started?</strong> One of our core classes is Multimedia Storytelling. Their final project includes blending writing, audio, documentary work, and photos. But to really get an in-depth understanding of what this work is, I would recommend the Summer Scholars program. Pol Le ’25 and Anna Jones ’24 did the WildeCamp story (in <em>10,000 Acres</em>). That kind of work doesn’t happen during a semester. They had 10 weeks, and that was the only thing they were doing. That was a transformative experience not only for them but for me in understanding what those Summer Scholars programs can be. <strong>You had no reservations in allowing a student such as Sarah Hume to become a significant contributor. How did that evolve?</strong> Sarah Hume is our superstar. For senior projects, she and another student went out and found stories. There wasn’t a professor who said, “I have some subjects for you, see what you can do with them.” Sarah was working on a professional level in her fourth year of college. She wrote a great story that got published in Belt magazine. Sarah is my main editor. She has been fundamental on this project. <strong>What is the story behind Figgy and her presence on campus?</strong> We got Figgy two days before Christmas several years ago. My wife had a fear of dogs, so we knew we needed a gentle one. She’s the one who picked out Figgy. Well, actually, Figgy picked her out, walking up to her and giving my wife a gentle lick on the cheek. At the time, we didn’t know six months later Michèle would be diagnosed with ovarian cancer, and seven months after that, we would lose her. When I lost Michèle, I didn’t know what to do because Figgy is not a dog you can leave at home all day. Little by little, I began bringing her to campus with me, and the students love her. She supports me, gets me through hard days. ",

If I’m successful, you can feel that relationship, from the first Native Americans to the people who manage giraffes and rhinos at the wildlife sanctuary,” says Swift, who has been “circling around this story for more than 10 years — and actively working on it for two.” He unearths an unexpectedly rich source of material in a 10,000-acre reclaimed strip mine located in southeastern Ohio. In Michener-esque style, Swift illustrates the <a href=\"https://10kacresdoc.org/a-very-brief-history-of-coal/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">geologic processes</a> that formed its rich resources, then chronicles the people who lived in relationship to the land over centuries, including the caretakers of the zebras that now roam these Ohio hills. Along the way, <em>10,000 Acres</em> pays homage to the <a href=\"https://10kacresdoc.org/indigenous-americans/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Adena culture</a> via a burial mound that still exists on the property, saved from strip mining by a gas line. Pioneer-era histories follow, stopping for a long moment on the <a href=\"https://10kacresdoc.org/the-lett-settlement/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Lett Settlement</a>, a community of mixed-race farmers and tradespeople. Members of this community had to sue for the right to educate their children, and to vote, setting important civil rights precedents, Swift says. Today, these 10,000 acres are bringing new riches to the area via a steady stream of tourism. <a href=\"https://10kacresdoc.org/visionaries/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">The Wilds</a>, a private, nonprofit conservation center, devotes 1,500 acres to accommodate more than 500 animals representing 28 rare and <a href=\"https://10kacresdoc.org/the-wilds/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">endangered species</a>, and manages the grassland and forest ecologies of the 8,000-plus remaining acres. <em>10,000 Acres</em> serves as a historical document — a testament to the land and those who lived and worked there. Firsthand accounts are supported by photographs, informational graphics, video, and audio clips sourced from personal collections. To tell a tale this big, Swift needed many <a href=\"https://10kacresdoc.org/acknowledgements/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">helping hands</a>. Denison earth sciences professor Erik Klemetti and environmental studies professor Doug Spieles contributed their expertise. Artist Mary Ann Bucci provided illustrations. Composer Matt Jackfert knit the documentaries together through a unifying score. Journalism students from Denison and West Virginia universities added narratives and documentaries. Each chapter is developed in the storyteller’s milieu — documentaries, short films, and longform journalism. These are not biographies of the wealthy people and companies who bought and sold the land. These stories focus on the people who lived and worked on the land. “Even with Black Lung, Few tells me, he wouldn’t trade his time on the Muskie for anything. He loved it. He loved the people. They were family.” The Wild’s <a href=\"https://10kacresdoc.org/as-much-habitat/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">grassland and forested preserve</a> has seen successes and challenges. While grasslands are not a naturally occurring habitat in Ohio, many species of birds accustomed to this environment have migrated here. Flocks of bobolinks and Henslow’s sparrows are thriving in their new home. However, that tapestry is now under threat from yet another human intervention. Autumn olive, an unprepossessing shrub imported from Asia, was planted in the 1990s to stabilize the soil. Today it is classified as invasive. And it is fast encroaching on the grasslands. Few resources are available to combat the invasion, but local biologists are observing and researching the bird populations there. The hope is research will offer new avenues to save the grasslands. “We’ve done all this stuff with good intentions, but we have lived as if we could impose our will on nature,” Swift says. “We humans see time as a fixed thing, and when things start to shift or change we perceive that something is wrong. But the arc of this story shows that these changes, which are happening faster and faster, indicate if we want to have a relationship with nature, we will have to make a reckoning with it.” ",

His residency next year will give our students an unparalleled opportunity to learn from an acclaimed poet and critic whose incisive cultural commentary is vital to our present moment.” The Nowik Writer-in-Residence program was established through the generosity of Denison Alumni Council Trustee Kathryn Correia ’79 and Stephen Correia to bring top poets, writers, literary scholars, and critics to campus. Abdurraqib is the second recipient, following Pulitzer Prize winner Connie Schultz. His residency will begin in the fall of 2023. Abdurraqib — whose books include <em>They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us, Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest</em>, and <em>A Little Devil in America</em>, which received 2022 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Nonfiction — will teach two weeklong master classes each semester of his residency, expanding a relationship with Denison that includes appearances as part of the university’s <a href=\"/series/beck\">Beck Series</a> and the summertime <a href=\"https://reynolds.denison.edu/\" class=\"external-link\">Reynolds Young Writers Workshop</a>. “I have enjoyed the time I have spent at Denison in recent years, working with young writers and building relationships with undergraduate writers as well,” Abdurraqib said. “My hope is that my presence on campus will continue to enhance that exchange and build relationships that further strengthen the already vibrant community of writers who call Ohio home.” The Columbus, Ohio, native released his first full-length poetry collection, <em>The Crown Ain’t Worth Much</em>, in June 2016 and was a finalist for the Eric Hoffer Book Prize. In the winter of the following year, his first collection of essays, <em>They Can’t Kill Us Until They Kill Us</em>, met with wide acclaim and was named a book of the year by outlets including <em>Esquire</em>, NPR, Pitchfork, and the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>. In 2019 he released <em>Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes to A Tribe Called Quest</em>, which became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, followed later that year by his second collection of poems, <em>A Fortune for Your Disaster</em>. His 2021 essay collection, <em>A Little Devil in America</em>, was a finalist for the National Book Award and the National Book Critics Circle Award. That same year, Abdurraqib was awarded a prestigious MacArthur Fellowship, sometimes called a “Genius Grant.” “He would have every reason to be full of himself, and it’s just the absolute opposite — he’s so approachable, so generous, so humble,” said author Margot Singer, director of creative writing at Denison and the former director of the Reynolds Workshop, a writing program for high school students. “He relates to students in a way that’s so uniquely Hanif. He has come to Reynolds several times, and the students are just rapt.” Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023.

They also discussed the importance of students taking advantage of experiences outside the classroom, developing a proper mindset, and cultivating relationships as vital components of becoming a lifelong learner. Denison’s president said seeking out the mentorship of faculty and staff is critical to a successful four-year run in college. So is forming relationships with fellow students who might not come from similar backgrounds or share the same philosophical or political views. “I think fundamentally, life-transforming education is about the relational piece, and it’s about the experiences,” Weinberg said. Selingo and Weinberg also discussed the issue of mental health. Weinberg talks about helping students understand that they have more control over their physical and psychological health than they sometimes believe. Colleges need to help students learn the habits and skills of well-being, which includes good habits around sleep, exercise, nutrition, and technology and social media. He added that colleges could also help students manage the daily stresses we all face by giving students opportunities to learn various forms of mindfulness. He commented, “folks really should be paying attention to the <a href=\"https://www.mindandlife.org/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Mind and Life Institute</a> and the research they’ve been doing.” Selingo and Weinberg also outlined the pressures involving the college admissions process and how students too often are consumed with getting “into their college of choice” rather than asking “who they want to be.” They would like to see high schools prepare students for the challenges at the college level. For Weinberg, a key is developing resilience and understanding how to deal with failure. “We’re so worried that if they experience any bit of failure, they won’t get into a good college, that we’re not giving them the space to learn that failure is the only way to develop the kind of resiliency you’re going to need to be successful in life,” Weinberg said. “I often say to our students, ‘Once you get over your fear of failure and your fear of embarrassment, life gets a lot easier.’ I think one of the great things about residential college is you get to learn all this stuff in a safe, supportive place.” College is supposed to be challenging – whether it’s facing adversity in the classroom, the athletic fields or in any number of extracurricular activities. Among the inherent challenges of college are learning to live away from home, interacting with fellow students in residential halls and accepting that courses will be challenging but that they will prepare you for life after school. “It’s about helping students understand that those struggles are normal,” Weinberg said. “They’re part of the process by design … don’t assume when you’re having a moment of unhappiness, a moment of wondering whether you can make it, that everybody else around you is doing great.” <strong>Learn more and listen to <a href=\"https://www.nais.org/learn/nais-podcasts/new-view-edu/episode-29-the-future-of-higher-ed/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">New View EDU from the National Association of Independent Schools</a>.</strong> Find New View EDU on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-view-edu/id1577396185\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5hY2FzdC5jb20vcHVibGljL3Nob3dzL25ldy12aWV3LWVkdQ\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/2fWs5bC13udNSVkvO8sKip\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/show/new-view-edu\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>, and many other podcast apps.

    "content": "On Oct. 20, the Professional Grounds Management Society (PGMS) recognized the Denison Grounds Crew with three national awards: “I am so proud and grateful for Kevin and his team for the thoughtful attention they pay to every detail of our campus,” said Denison President Adam Weinberg. “The work they do creates an incredible campus that enhances the experience of our students, staff, faculty, and visitors. We all benefit from their talents and commitment to the campus.” Nature provided Denison with a magnificent canvas, and the campus master plan, devised in 1918, layered atop it a blueprint so well-conceived that the university continues to follow it to this day. To many, this comes as no surprise — it was designed by the renowned landscape architectural firm of <a href=\"https://www.olmsted.org/the-olmsted-legacy/frederick-law-olmsted-sr\" class=\"external-link\">Frederick Law Olmsted</a>, the founder of landscape architecture and designer of such iconic spaces as New York City’s famed Central Park. Today, thanks to Denison’s dedicated grounds professionals, Denison’s gorgeous campus thrives — the culmination of excellence in planning and execution. Mercer and his crew — Ann Cherry, Dan Freeman, John Hill, Gram Lewis, Dominic Moore, John Palmer, Caden Snyder, and&nbsp;Mac Walker&nbsp; — carefully tend to the planting, trimming, watering, and weeding of the 150-acre campus. Not only was Mercer the driving force behind Denison’s recent recognition, but he also spurred PGMS to create a new category to recognize Olmsted properties across the country, connecting the grounds organization with the National Association for Olmsted Parks to create an <a href=\"https://pgms.org/news/597361/PGMS-Announces-New-Awards-Category-in-Collaboration-with-the-National-Association-For-Olmsted-Parks.htm\" class=\"external-link\">award recognizing the care and maintenance of parks and grounds</a> designed by the famed landscape architectural firm. “The team is pretty upset we didn’t come in first on the Olmsted award,” Mercer said. “But it’s not so bad to lose to the Biltmore and tie with the National Mall.” For Mercer, these awards validate his team’s efforts. “I’m so proud of them,” he said. “We are competing against places with many times our resources and employees, and we always end up in the top tier.” Their success is no accident — it results from a team culture based on shared values: concern for others, excellence, professional development, sustainability, accountability, and stewardship. Mercer’s values-based leadership is grounded in something Denison Chief Financial Officer David English told him when Mercer joined the university in 2017. “He told me that our students are our biggest focus, and we’re part of that work, too,” Mercer said. “I realized that our product was bigger than just taking care of the grounds — we are part of an entire campus team to support our students.” The team keeps those values in mind as they spend their days shaping, clearing, and pruning. Palmer, who has been with Denison for 33 years, likes the feeling that everyone is pulling together. “Kevin shares the work out evenly,” he said. “We have to buckle down, but we can enjoy each other, too.” Hill says he enjoys student interactions the most. He especially appreciates getting to know the international students who often join the crew as much-needed extra hands in the summer. “I like teaching them how to use machinery,” Hill said. “They do things here they would never do in their home countries.” The grounds crew has a vigorous ally in Jean Preston ’55, a master gardener and champion for beautiful environments and their benefits — a passion her husband honored by establishing the Jean Holman Preston Horticultural Fund at Denison. Preston and Mercer work together, drawing up lists and plans for the trees, shrubs, and flower beds that beautify the campus, deriving their inspiration from the Olmsted master plan. Through the years, they have developed a special friendship. “Jean is a mentor to me,” Mercer said. “When someone believes in you and your team, you want to do something special for them.” Mercer wanted Preston’s efforts and support to be celebrated. He contacted Dede Petri, president of the Olmsted Association, about Preston and her work bringing Olmsted’s vision to life. Petri responded by offering to visit campus to lead a June 2022 ceremony in honor of Preston and her recognition “that landscapes are not just pretty spaces. They are an intrinsic part of the university’s distinctive liberal arts experience.“ “It was the bicentennial of Olmsted’s birthday and a great way to honor Jean,” Mercer said. With “concern for others” at the top of their values list, it’s not surprising that Mercer and his team keep their eye out for ways to lend others a helping hand. In 2020, they learned about Andrew, a friend’s young son, a little boy who loved baseball and was hospitalized with leukemia. After weeks of organizing and preparations, the crew built a <a href=\"/campus/finance-management/feature/136654\">miniature baseball diamond</a> in Andrew’s backyard and — at Mercer’s request — Andrew’s favorite team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, pitched in as well. Everything was ready just in time for Andrew’s return from the hospital. Andrew’s family sends updates to the Denison team. The good news: Andrew is in remission. “I sometimes wonder if we helped a little,” Palmer said, “knowing he could look out at that yard and keep his hopes up.” Mercer recently sent Andrew a special baseball bat from the Louisville Slugger Museum. Mercer’s most recent campus project follows the <a href=\"https://www.nps.gov/frla/learn/historyculture/flo.htm\" class=\"external-link\">Olmsted directive</a> to create a “sense of the peacefulness of nature” and “soothe and restore the spirit.” He and Japanese Professor Michael Tangeman resuscitated a mostly forgotten nook between Doane Library and Fellows Hall. They created a restful Japanese garden with a bridge across a water feature and a small bench for contemplation. For Mercer, it was yet another opportunity to build a new partnership, create another moment of beauty on campus, and celebrate his team. “We just work together to make this a great place for students,” he said. Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023. Five recent graduates helped to secure the prestigious designation — the fifth time in six years Denison has been named a Top Producer. ",

    "content": "She understands why many Asian American women like her sometimes feel unsafe, even today. More than 9,000 instances of anti-Asian violence have been reported since the pandemic, including the Atlanta shootings of six Asian women. She wanted to create a safe place “for Asian youth, by Asian youth,” says Do-Truong, who identifies as TIGNC (transgender, intersex, and gender non-conforming). With that goal in mind, Do-Truong wrote and submitted a proposal to the <a href=\"https://www.middlebury.edu/office/projects-for-peace\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Davis Projects for Peace</a> to create programs to build a community for these young women, a space where they could share their experiences and gain the knowledge to create lasting change in their communities. She was awarded a $10,000 grant to bring her vision to life in her hometown during the summer of 2022. Step one accomplished, the real work began. It turns out that $10,000 doesn’t stretch very far in Boston. Do-Truong sharpened her grant writing skills even further. She reached out to the <a href=\"https://www.aarw.org/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Asian American Resource Workshop</a>, a grassroots political organization for pan-Asian communities in Greater Boston, which provided the fiscal platform she needed to apply for additional grants. Her additional proposals landed two more grants that totaled $10,400. “When you build out a program, one of the first things you do is think about the finances,” she says. “I learned a lot about legality and fiscal sponsorship.” These funds, together with the Davis award, allowed her to rent space and stipends for her co-facilitator and guest workshop speakers. They also provided program materials and meals for the participants. “We hosted 15 participants between the ages of 16-24 who identified as young Asian cis-women or genderqueer youth,” says Do-Truong. Relationships and partnerships quickly became critical to the program’s success. Do-Truong and her co-facilitator met weekly to plan the curriculum for the seven-week empowerment series, and the director of Asian-American Resource Workshop offered advice on how to build spaces for cross-racial programs. The <a href=\"https://www.vietaid.org/community-center/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">VietAID Community Center</a>, where her parents had taken ESL lessons, proved to be a great location for participants that hailed from all over Greater Boston. And local experts provided a community self-defense and yoga workshop. Do-Truong’s learning curve was huge. In addition to writing grants, hiring teachers and facilitators, and negotiating rental space, she learned the importance of transparency, logistical work, and accessibility, she says. Meanwhile, she was also holding an internship as a summer urban programming director with the Phillips Brooks House Association at Harvard University, organizing community events, managing young staff, and preparing and presenting workshops on teamwork, community, and college preparation. The summer taught her countless lessons, including patience — with others, and with herself. “When I started this program, I had high expectations,” she says. “I wanted people to learn about everything in regards to Asian American history and community organizing — but they could only meet weekly for two-to-four hours. I had to pull back and realize they will learn what they need to learn. Learning will take time.” “And I learned how much I like to work with youth and community, not only as a builder, but to see the people I came to know move forward. And I know the community has my back.” ",

That’s why, as Denison continues to shape the first-year student experience, the university partnered with the nonprofit organization <a href=\"https://braverangels.org/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Braver Angels</a> in 2022 to add intentional ways “for students to learn, to exchange political ideas and engage in intellectual debate,” Weinberg said. During a recent Higher Ed Now podcast (produced by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni), Weinberg and&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"15deb0c6-5c3f-454c-933c-6eaa576a8cb3\" href=\"/people/adam-davis\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Adam Davis</a>, director of the&nbsp;<a href=\"/career/research\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement</a> and the John L. and Christine Warner Family Endowed Professor of History, discussed how the university is igniting civil discourse on campus. Weinberg and Davis shared details about Denison’s new <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"ecf9884f-c875-48a0-bd54-d80b25312483\" href=\"/node/146828\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">August Orientation initiative</a> — an experiential campuswide debate in partnership with Braver Angels — that teaches students about civil discourse before they step foot into a classroom. “The goal of having a debate as a centerpiece of freshman orientation is to make sure (students) see it as normal, as vital, as a healthy part of what college is about,” Davis said. In the episode, Weinberg and Davis discussed the format of the debates, including a debrief workshop that helps students process what they experienced and learn how to apply their learning to their classroom experiences and lives. “We’re super proud of the intellectual and political diversity of our campus,” Weinberg said on the podcast, recalling his <a href=\"https://youtu.be/42KVibk_vJ8?t=1318\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Class of 2026 Induction speech</a>. “I challenged all of our first-year students to, at some point during their first month on campus, figure out who in their residential halls life experiences are most different from their own and find a way to form a friendship. And then we asked them if somebody says something in a classroom that they find really uncomfortable — maybe even offensive — take them out for coffee. And don’t ask them about their politics — ask them about their life. Once you understand somebody’s life history, sometimes their intellectual and political views make more sense.” Podcast host Doug Sprei, a vice president at the American Council of Trustees and Alumni and leader of its College Debates and Discourse initiative, said the work he’s done at Denison with Braver Angels is “signaling to students that when you step foot on this campus, you’re in a place where all perspectives are respected and honored, and someone who you disagree with is not your enemy.” Maintaining campus health and safety—while also allowing a full college experience—requires a shift in thinking and partnership with students. Pandemic uncertainty has reinforced the need for an adaptable, flexible workforce with the ability to learn. Liberal arts students are one answer. President Weinberg outlines higher education mega-shifts and changing expectations in a USA Today op-ed. International Studies major Khalil Bentley '20 has been awarded a prestigious Thomas R. Pickering Foreign Affairs Graduate Fellowship. Rachel Abbott '19 will teach children and explore Germany — thanks to a Fulbright award. Strong faculty relationships guided Andrea Weyneth ‘19 on her path to a Fulbright. Each summer, endowed funds support 120 to 140 students pursuing research under the supervision of a faculty member for up to 10 weeks An NSF grant gives students a rare opportunity to study the impact of geologic processes in real time. A Fulbright Scholarship will bring Julia Laden ’19 to the Canary Islands, where she will teach English to young children. ",

In this elevated role, he will lead the strategic development and oversight of response, engagement, and compliance efforts for civil rights and Title IX. Brown will join Denison on Oct. 31, 2022, following Joe Hall, who served as interim Title IX director. In this newly defined role, Brown will have oversight of the college’s Title IX program. He will also partner with Denison’s general counsel and colleagues across campus in divisions and offices, including Student Life, Human Resources, Academics, and Athletics to enhance efforts on belonging, campus climate, and civil rights. “This expanded role is critical for maintaining a community affirmatively built on collaboration, engagement, inclusion, and free from discrimination and harassment,” said Denison President Adam Weinberg. “Justin’s experience and expertise will enhance our efforts on Title IX and civil rights to ensure we are continually working to create a campus of belonging and respect.” Brown joins Denison with almost 15 years of experience as a professional in Title IX, conflict resolution, and policy work. In his most recent position, he served as associate dean of students and director of the Office of Student Conflict Resolution at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He holds a master’s from Indiana University Bloomington and a bachelor’s from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “I am incredibly excited to join the Denison community. I have a passion for Title IX and civil rights and have a fair, thorough, and compassionate approach to all situations,” Brown said. “I look forward to building productive partnerships and friendships with students, faculty, and staff at Denison.” Reporting to the provost, Brown will liaise with campus partners to develop, monitor, and update policies and processes related to Title IX and civil rights. He will oversee and help coordinate educational and engagement opportunities for students and employees that address these issues. Justin will also partner with students, faculty, and staff on furthering our goal of becoming a community grounded in sexual respect. “I look forward to Justin’s partnership on our integrated approach to civil rights and Title IX,” said Denison Provost Kim Coplin. “His knowledge also makes him a natural partner on diversity and inclusion issues to advance our Denison Forward work.” Brown will be cross-designated as a Division of Student Life management team member. This direct association and support from the vice president of student life will help ensure the role’s connectivity to student concerns and strategic and day-to-day partners, including the Center for Belonging and Inclusion, Hoaglin Wellness Center, Residential Communities, Fraternity and Sorority Life, Orientation and First-Year Experience, Student Conduct, and Campus Safety. “Justin’s perspective will be a great addition to our team,” said Vice President for Student Life Alex Miller. “The relationships he builds with our students will help us achieve our goals in student life, athletics, and student employment. I also want to thank and acknowledge the great work Joe Hall has done as interim Title IX director.” Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023.

    "content": "Runk doesn’t notice many fellow students scrolling through their cell phones. She doesn’t observe them sitting in the spacious lobby or the outdoor meditation garden with noses buried in laptops. What Runk often witnesses, she says, is students using the 16,000-square-foot center for one of its intended purposes — a place to quiet the mind and recharge the body. It’s clear students are taking advantage of the wellness-centered programs and opportunities within the limestone walls of the Hoaglin Center, a single-story structure that sits along Denison’s famed Chapel Walk and opened at the start of the 2022-23 school year. More than 2,200 students and staff members registered for wellness programs in the first two months — a total that does not include visits for the medical and individual counseling services offered at Hoaglin. “Before Covid, you would hear professors and faculty members say that it’s important to take time away from school work and just destress,” Runk said. “But I think there was a disconnect between what was being said and what was being done. Since this space opened, I see more students taking the time to do that.” Even before the first spade of dirt was turned at groundbreaking, the university sought to accommodate a generation of students looking for resources to manage their own well-being. “There has been a huge shift,” said Jack Wheeler, associate director of student wellness at the Hoaglin Center. “This generation is far more likely to have a conversation about their mental-health journey or just their general mental well-being. They also are a lot quicker to seek services.” In recent years, Denison has been broadening its definition of wellness, creating educational programs that encourage a holistic approach and helping students develop the habits and skills to manage their health and well-being on campus and throughout their lifetimes. Denison was among five universities in 2020 to earn an Active Minds Healthy Campus Award, which recognizes excellence in prioritizing the health and well-being of students. Emphasizing the importance of sleep, nutrition, and exercise on physical and mental health, President Adam Weinberg has been a vocal proponent of helping students develop “emotional agility and resilience” that enables them to thrive not only in their time at Denison, but in the years beyond. The centerpiece of this effort is the Hoaglin facility, named in honor of Ann and Thomas, both members of the Denison Class of 1971 and longtime champions for their alma mater who led the philanthropic effort behind the center. Hoaglin not only established a hub for health and wellness-centered activities on campus, it also expanded these services through Denison’s new partnership with the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. The center’s arrival on campus could not have come at a better time. She cited a recent study from the Collegiate Mental Health Report that found 72% of American college students say Covid has impacted their mental health in a negative way. “Young adults are aware of the strong connection between mental and physical health,” Humeidan said. “Having the Hoaglin center at Denison that attends to the whole person allows students to more holistically engage in their well-being.” She also referenced a survey from the Census Bureau that states symptoms of anxiety and depression “on a near-daily basis” had spiked to 41% among adults in 2021 — a 30% increase from 2019. Beyond isolation and other challenges faced during the pandemic, factors such as the political climate, uncertainty about the future, and changes in access to social support have contributed to a rise in anxiety, according to a 2022 Harris poll. Nearly 700 individual therapy sessions have been offered over the past six weeks at Hoaglin Counseling Services, Humeidan said, and at least one quarter of enrolled students seek counseling services at some point in their academic journey. Humeidan is one of seven full-time mental health clinicians working at the Hoaglin Center’s counseling services. A part-time psychiatrist from the Ohio State Wexner Medical Center also recently joined the team. One-on-one mental health assessments and therapy sessions are common at most universities, and necessary for diagnosable clinical mental health disorders, but Humeidan lauds the proactive work of Denison’s wellness programs which help enhance mental and physical well-being. “When students come to us, they are quite positive about the new center, its location, and quick access to a broad range of services,” she said. “We are continuing to assess needs and looking to increase collaboration across departments to enhance positive coping, emotional regulation, and self care among students — all skills that can also be taught outside of one-on-one counseling.” But it’s the serenity of the wellness center’s environment that helps her relieve stress after a busy day of classes. Students are using the new facility for a wide variety of reasons beyond medical treatment and counseling. There are rooms for meditation, yoga, and spinning, and group chats. Visits from therapy dogs are popular, as are the occasional campfires, morning smoothies, and paint nights. The wellness rooms, which students, staff, and faculty can reserve for 30-minute visits, are a huge hit. Occupants can take a well-being break and relax in massage chairs, listen to soft music and trickling water, and indulge in aromatherapy. “In our survey, 53% of the students who responded said they have attended a program here,” Wheeler said. “We know students are struggling with time — that’s one of the barriers that was mentioned — but sometimes all you need is just a few minutes to drop in and turn off. “Students who come in seem to be more optimistic and hopeful. They see this as a space where they can relax and destress in an atmosphere that’s different than what’s going on across campus.” ",

The university held a Buzzy Bash for Denison Legacies at the Mitchell Center, in which multiple generations gathered to peruse old yearbooks and have their pictures taken with their class banners. Not every second-generation student has a sweatshirt from their parent’s closet, but there’s a fabric in the shared experience that binds them and never goes out of style. “This is my favorite weekend of the year,” said Kirstin Heinritz ’92, who flew from Colorado to join her daughter Annie Heinritz ’24 in Granville. “I used to love when my mother would come here and spend time with me, and now I get to do the same with my daughter.”&nbsp; Big Red Weekend, a tradition dating to 2008, honors parents, alumni, and friends of the university. This year, organizers spotlighted the opening of the Hoaglin Wellness Center, the history of women’s sports at Denison, and the retirement of a trailblazing professor. The weekend also saw more legacy families participate in their featured gathering. “One of the goals of the college is engagement, and who’s more engaged than an alumni parent?” said Susan Stoner Leithauser ’90, senior development officer for Parent and Family Philanthropy. An estimated 1,200 parents, alumni, and friends of the university roamed the campus, attended special functions and sporting events, and walked down to the village to catch up with old classmates and make new acquaintances. Ella Jordan ’26 couldn’t get over how much her mother, Susan Tetzlaff Jordan ’87, enjoyed having lunch with six friends at Broadway Pub. Susan said another highlight was attending a Q&amp;A with Denison President Adam Weinberg on Saturday. “Adam is helping bring about so many positive changes to the university while still managing to keep the right continuity,” Susan Jordan said. On Friday, the athletic department unveiled a mural at the Mitchell Center paying tribute to the 50th anniversary of Title IX, the landmark civil rights law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in schools or educational programs that receive federal funding. Kate Hinshaw ’24, a member of the field hockey team, created the stunning collage that features 200 photos of Denison female athletes past and present. She also contributed to an <a href=\"https://www.50yearsoftitleixatdenison.com/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">interactive website</a> that explains who’s in the mural.&nbsp; On Saturday, the university honored the legacy of Black Studies Professor John L. Jackson, <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"40304238-761a-4447-81b0-980eb5f46405\" href=\"/magazine/summer-2022/146239\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">who retired in the spring after 48 years of service</a>. Through his tireless work, Jackson helped Denison adopt a diversity requirement as part of its general education standards in 1979 — a first in American higher education. “I just loved the energy on campus,” Delaney said. “I visited here with my mom, and when we went home, I told my dad, ‘I’m going to Denison.’” Ross Servick supplied one of the weekend’s best stories involving his Sigma Chi fraternity brother Jeffrey Walker ’91. After graduation, the two men discovered that Servick’s mom and Walker’s dad were both single and living in Delray Beach, Florida. Not long after introducing their parents, the old fraternity brothers became stepbrothers, adding another connective thread that runs through the university. 2. Ross Servick ’91 and Jeffrery Walker ’91 went from Sigma Chi fraternity brothers to stepbrothers after introducing Servick’s mom to Walker’s dad 19 years ago. ",

    "content": "His evolution takes several forms. From updating his pop culture references to using advanced digital technology to give his students a nuanced view of Richard III, Porcheddu-Engel has managed to keep up with the times. “It’s new tools and technologies that frankly, as humanists, we have got to get on the ball with because otherwise, we’re still teaching literature basically the same way that people were in the 1890s,” Porcheddu-Engel says The effervescent professor took a break from building a website dedicated to a 15th century manuscript, a gift to the university from an alum, to discuss his 30-year teaching career at Denison. The feeling that I got at Denison when I came for my first visit was very strong, and while I couldn’t articulate it at the time, I knew it was the right place for me. I was very bookish and introverted, but the faculty ran me through my paces when they spotted my eagerness for learning. That’s when I knew I was going to become a teacher. After I’d been in graduate school for a short time, I talked to my fellow grad students and I realized none of them had been as nurtured and challenged in their undergraduate years as I had been. That’s something special. I thought if there’s any way that I can continue in the Denison tradition of meaningful faculty interactions with students, I knew that’s what I wanted to do. It’s my dream job. I don’t want to get too romantic or sentimental or mystical about it, but I sincerely want to pay it forward for the excellent education that I got here. There’s always a vitality with a new class of students. They bring energy. The thing that causes me to be constantly refreshed, however, is the ethos of this place. And for the past several years, it’s been the effect of (Denison President) Adam Weinberg, of whom I have such a high opinion. The man, since he stepped foot on this campus, has made informed and humane and thoughtful decisions about the direction of the college, about the way that we talk about ourselves, and what our true values are. I’ve always been proud to work here, but Adam Weinberg and the upper administration of the college make me roll forward on the balls of my feet. I’ve always been interested in older things. I don’t know why. My parents were both older. They were in their 50s when I was a teenager. Our house was full of early 20th century stuff. We had old records, and I grew up listening to big band music and swing music. But there’s a lot of paths around here that influenced me. As a student, I responded to a couple of English faculty members who were here at Denison. Their delight, their command of the material, their thoughtfulness about it was wonderful. They weren’t trying to impose on their students a reading of anything particular. They were saying, ‘Here’s one way of looking at it. What do you think?’ Those are open-ended sorts of things. And I thought, ‘That’s it.’ It’s the method that’s the point here — it’s not the actual material itself. So, I need to be attracted to whatever material I’m attracted to — and in this case it’s older, obscure stuff — but the method of generous sharing and delight in talking about these old things will always be there whatever specialization I choose. I don’t put much stock into intellectual dignity. It kind of ends up being an esoteric distance that faculty keep from their students. I think it’s entirely counterproductive. I may know a lot more about this time period, about this subject, than any of my students, but that’s irrelevant. What I need to do is to try to develop in them an interest and an understanding that none of these things have been decided yet. I’m not transferring information one way. I want to hear how they see this piece of writing. That’s how you keep things from being dull. But humor is absolutely necessary because it grounds us all. So if you can be self-deprecating, if you can be silly in front of your students, you’re at least halfway to having won them over. ",

    "content": "Guided by a deliberate and detailed strategic plan unveiled in 2015, Denison has expanded its academic programs, invested in the arts and athletics, and strengthened its student recruitment. These accomplishments have led to a steep rise in applications and growing recognition among prospective students and peer institutions of Denison’s place among the country’s top liberal arts colleges. Today, newly released <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> college rankings further reinforce Denison’s continued upward trajectory. In 2023 rankings determined by surveys with top college officials, Denison ranked <strong>No. 9 most innovative</strong> and <strong>No. 9 most international liberal arts college</strong> in the country, as well as the <strong>No. 19 best college of any type in the country for internships</strong>, tied with Clemson, Notre Dame, and Harvard. Overall, Denison is ranked <strong>No. 39 among national liberal arts colleges</strong> — a leap of 16 places since 2016 — and is the <strong>22nd most selective liberal arts college</strong> in the country, according to the leading producer of college rankings. While the rise in rankings reflects Denison’s momentum over the past decade, it only tells a fraction of the life-shaping academics, exploration, and innovation taking place on The Hill. “The students choosing to come to Denison are highly motivated, engaged, and excited to be challenged by their experiences on The Hill,” says Denison University President Adam Weinberg. “And we’re matching that talent and enthusiasm with world-class faculty, facilities, and resources that are helping unlock the potential of our students to be the architects of their lives. This external recognition is a testament to the dedication of our students, faculty, and staff to making the most of the transformative liberal arts education and opportunities we offer here on The Hill.” Applications to Denison have nearly tripled over the past decade as the college has also become more selective, with admission rates dropping to an all-time low of 22% for the Class of 2026. Meanwhile, the university has committed to making a Denison education accessible to lower- and middle-income students and is one of the few colleges in the country to meet the full demonstrated financial aid need of every admitted student. “Among the many things we do well, Denison gets the relationships right,” Weinberg said. “Our students form lifelong friendships with peers from around the world, they develop life-changing mentoring relationships with faculty and staff who both support and challenge them in ways that lead to remarkable personal growth, and they graduate into an alumni community that is ready to help them explore careers and land great jobs.” In recent years, Denison also created a robust new model for career exploration and internship placement through the <a href=\"/career/knowlton-center\">Knowlton Center for Career Exploration</a> — helping students launch quickly and successfully into lives and careers. “Our Knowlton Center establishes the gold standard for career exploration, including internship placement, and that along with our rigorous academic experience sets our graduates up for success,” said Vice President for Enrollment Management Gregory Sneed. “These rankings by <em>U.S. News</em> place us firmly in the company of the nation’s most storied and respected institutions, and reinforce what we already know — that there is immense value in Denison’s transformative experience.” In determining its rankings, <em>U.S. News</em> weighs metrics including graduation and retention, graduation rate performance, graduate indebtedness, social mobility, faculty resources, expert opinion, financial resources, student excellence, and alumni giving. Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023. Five recent graduates helped to secure the prestigious designation — the fifth time in six years Denison has been named a Top Producer. ",

    "content": "Bridget Welch ’22 Welch is an English creative writing major with a minor in narrative journalism. She plans to go into the entertainment industry. I’ve done it two times before. As a member of Denison’s improv troupe, the Burpee’s, sleep deprivation is tradition — it is simply a part of one of our favorite shows of the year: the Burpee’s Annual 24-Hour Improv Show. Between us, the Burpee’s presence on campus is one of the main reasons I chose to attend Denison. As an anxious first-year, I wouldn’t have told anyone (to spare myself the embarrassment if I didn’t make it), but I was set on auditioning for the group from my first day on The Hill four years ago. No — even before that! I was set on auditioning after I saw the group perform at an admitted students event during my senior year of high school. Luckily for me, I made the cut. Improv is where I found my people. I know it sounds cheesy, but the practice is so vulnerable. When you agree to open up, be the weirdest version of yourself, and say “yes” to a group of individuals, you bond. The 24-Hour Show is a bonding experience on steroids. Obviously, it’s like a big sleepover, which is probably the number one way to get close to your friends. But also, it’s a big opportunity to work toward a common goal. It works like this: Audience members donate to make suggestions for our improv scenes. We lose a lot of sleep. We have a lot of fun. Another cool thing about being a Burpee: The alumni are so supportive, and we keep in touch. Burpee’s alumni donate to the cause and they relive their experiences too, talking about how they “happily torture” themselves to “entertain a few brave audience members.” As a current member, I read that as a sarcastic way of admitting they just liked spending time with each other, a clever way of saying they love each other. I can attest that this banter lives on today. Joining the Burpees is like joining a family on campus. (And it’s pretty cool being part of a group with <a href=\"https://denison.edu/academics/theatre/wh/40150\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Steve Carell </a>’<a href=\"https://denison.edu/academics/theatre/wh/40150\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">84</a>). It’s hard to believe that I won’t be flailing around on Denison stages next year, or staying up 24 hours in a row to make a difference with my best friends. I’m not sure what my life will look like without practice twice a week and frequent performances around every corner of campus. It will be hard to say goodbye, but I know I will always be a part of the widespread Burpee’s community, long after my last bow on The Hill. ",

    "content": "Tom Reed “We can’t replace her,” Denison hockey coach Jeff German said. “There’s a giant hole with her leaving.” Reiner has taken her love of sports and the lessons she’s learned in the university’s burgeoning data analytics program and parlayed them into a dream job with the Toronto Maple Leafs of the National Hockey League. While German can’t use Reiner as a recruiting tool for his team, the academic department that helped launch her career certainly can. Laura Boyd, the director of Denison’s data analytics program, has shared the story of Reiner’s success with students considering enrollment in one of the university’s fastest-growing majors. Even before Reiner landed a job as a research and development analyst with the Maple Leafs, she brought national prominence to the school in 2021 as a collegiate-level winner in the NFL’s Big Data Bowl. Reiner not only earned a $5,000 prize but was interviewed by multiple media outlets, including the Expected Value Podcast. “<a href=\"http://www.trumedianetworks.com/expected-value-podcast/jill-reiner-ella-summer-nfl-big-data-bowl\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">I send the link to Jill’s interview</a>, and I hear kids say, ‘this is awesome — this is exactly what I want to do,’” Boyd said. Not just in the field of sports, either. The university’s data analytics program, founded in 2016, is placing graduates into corporate, nonprofit, and public-sector jobs. The explosion of data and the need for those who can build predictive models and communicate the findings have never been greater. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics has projected that employment of data scientists and mathematical science occupations will grow 31.4% from 2020 to 2030. Analytics is used in everything from financial institutions looking to expose fraud to public health departments trying to combat global pandemics to ride-share companies deciding which car to dispatch and what route it will take. “Every single aspect of our lives has some sort of data involved in it now,” said Nicholas Morton ’19, who works in the marketing/analytics division at Macy’s. “Marketing has turned into a numbers game, and everything is data-driven. Right down to when it’s the best time to send out an email to consumers.” Denison was among the first liberal arts colleges to offer data analytics as a major, and it’s proved to be a prescient decision — one that other universities are attempting to replicate. The program, with its roots in mathematics and computer science, is Denison’s sixth most-popular major. It had 173 students at the end of the 2022 spring semester. “The data analytics program at Denison has prepared me extremely well for any type of work, as I’ve not only learned to analyze all different types of data, but to think critically and thoughtfully through every situation,” <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"cf3786d9-a107-44f2-8a48-120def6d4d0d\" href=\"/academics/data-analytics/feature/141466\" target=\"_self\" class=\"internal-link\">Reiner told the university last year</a> after her NFL Big Data Bowl triumph. Boyd and Michael Brady, the outgoing associate director of data analytics, knew there was interest in the discipline when they began formulating the curriculum. They had hoped to attract about 40 candidates to the major over the first four years, but much to their surprise the program’s first graduating class in 2019 boasted 25 students. “We knew there was a huge opportunity in the marketplace,” Brady said, “and that there was no reason why a small liberal arts institution should cede that ground.” Brady and Boyd believed a data analytics program would mesh nicely with Denison’s overall educational approach, which promotes critical thinking, creative problem solving, storytelling, and autonomous learning. It’s an adaptable major, allowing students to leverage what they are also learning in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. Data analytics majors at Denison don’t just spend four years designing algorithms and honing math skills. There’s an emphasis on clearly communicating their work and ethically collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the data. Students are required to choose three classes of interdisciplinary work in a field of interest such as psychology, biology, philosophy, economics, environmental studies, anthropology, and sociology. They also can submit an individual plan to include such fields as sports analytics. Morgan Hogenmiller ’19 has a passion for the arts, and she used her data analytics degree to land a summer internship in New York with a theatrical management company. “My senior project was to study how long a Broadway show usually stays in New York before it has to close, and how a company can make the show successful,” said Hogenmiller, who’s pursuing her master’s degree at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. “After completing my senior project, I realized it’s something I would love to do for my career.” Hogenmiller, Morton, and Reiner became data analytics majors after taking an introductory course in it. Unlike some universities, the introductory class in Denison’s program, which is project-oriented, doesn’t require first-year students to have any experience with computer science or statistics. Reiner quickly realized the data-driven field could provide her with a pathway to a career in hockey, a sport she loved growing up in New York. “I took it in the second semester of my freshman year and had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do as a career at that point,” Reiner said last year. “That was the class that really drew me into the data analytics major.” ",

    "content": "Over the past few years, Denison has been expanding its definition of wellness, moving beyond physical and mental health to include wellness education to create lifelong habits for well-being. The university’s new <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"69711766-9500-428a-af04-16ef7967aa4a\" href=\"/map/places/hoaglin-wellness-center\">Ann and Thomas Hoaglin Wellness Center</a>, opened in late August 2022, advances these efforts and establishes a hub for medical, counseling, and wellness-centered activities for the entire campus community. The nearly 16,000-square-foot center, which replaces the health center once housed at Whisler Hall, is the culmination of years of collaborative planning and student-centered research. “A liberal arts education should help students develop the skills and habits they will need to thrive personally and professionally throughout their lives,” says Denison University President Adam Weinberg. “The Hoaglin Wellness Center will allow us to greatly expand the health services we offer our community to help them lead their best and healthiest lives.” At the Hoaglin Center, students will be able to consult primary care providers, mental health clinicians, psychiatrists, and dietitians, an expansion of care made possible by Denison’s new partnership with <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"2478f586-e229-4316-b091-2b7210a9877b\" href=\"/news-events/featured/145241\">The Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center</a>, one of the region’s most respected and established academic health centers. This partnership helps the college bring in additional health professionals to expand support for the full campus community — students, faculty, and staff — and to add health services including musculoskeletal and physical therapy as well as increased access to on-campus mental-health and sports medicine services. The Hoaglin Wellness Center is named for Ann and Tom Hoaglin, to <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"91c18543-8817-4387-8a12-cfdf51f670cc\" href=\"/news-events/featured/142287\">honor their philanthropic leadership</a> of the project. The Hoaglins, both members of the Denison Class of 1971, are long-time civic champions and passionate advocates for their alma mater, and their vision for the Hoaglin Center inspired several Denison alumni and parents of Denison students to support the project financially. “Ann and Tom have long been leaders in the Denison community, and I am grateful for their generosity, and for the gracious support of our alumni and parents who helped fund this project,” Weinberg says. “The interest in this project reflects the global understanding of the importance of good health and wellness.” The architectural design of the Hoaglin Wellness Center reflects Denison’s holistic wellness philosophy — the idea that all aspects of well-being are related. The building creates private spaces for consultations and clinical work and open, fluid spaces that support both learning and more casual student interactions, which also extends into the exterior landscape design. The single-story limestone structure sits along Denison’s Chapel Walk and takes advantage of abundant natural light and vistas. More than 2,600-square-feet of windows frame mature trees, an outdoor meditation garden, and multiple gathering spaces. Student input was critical to the Hoaglin Center’s development. To prepare for the building’s opening and new spaces, a group of faculty, staff, and students spent a year developing a vision and action plan for advancing a whole-campus culture of wellness. Julie Tucker, associate vice president of Student Life, also engaged student consultant teams from Denison’s <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"4f4010bf-2253-4969-8dc4-60902dce5937\" href=\"/career/entrepreneurship/red-corps-fellows\">Red Corps fellows</a> program to incorporate their voices into its planning and design. Tucker, who has been embedded in Denison’s wellness initiatives for more than a decade, says the aim of the center is to provide the resources students need to grow on campus and beyond. “Our goal is to challenge students to develop the skills and habits that lead to the kind of emotional agility and resilience that will allow them to thrive in their academics, activities, and relationships on campus,” she says. “These will also apply to their time post-graduation, giving them the means to flourish in their careers and personal connections through life.” The Hoaglin Wellness Center further strengthens Denison’s commitment to student well-being as part of a liberal arts education. In recent years, the college’s wellness team has added staffing resources to meet changing health needs, partnered with the <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"ffe44f0e-76b9-42ea-959c-a5887dbe76d0\" href=\"/places/wellness/feature/100857\">JED Foundation</a> to develop a plan for supporting student mental health, built a financial wellness program to support students’ financial well-being, and created partnerships throughout campus that address social and spiritual health as well as academic success. In 2020, Denison was recognized as an <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"75b81ae9-e3e0-4751-ba4b-6a1567af9515\" href=\"/news-events/featured/134886\">Active Minds Healthy Campus Award winner</a>. “We need a new conversation on college campuses about health,” Weinberg says. “We need to help students develop the skills and habits to shape their own health. This means talking about the ways life habits such as sleep, nutrition, and exercise impact both physical and mental health. It also means helping students develop the mindfulness tools and emotional agility needed to manage stress and the challenges we experience throughout our lives. I want our students to have the resilience and adaptability to be the architects of their own lives.” Mark Malloch-Brown, president of Open Society Foundations and former deputy secretary general of the U.N., will deliver the keynote on May 13, 2023. Five recent graduates helped to secure the prestigious designation — the fifth time in six years Denison has been named a Top Producer. ",

    "content": "There has been a significant increase in anxiety and depression among college students. Recent <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">data from the CDC</a> suggests a disproportionate risk for mental health problems in college-age people; one study reported that <a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2022/01/13/students-are-more-stressed-now-last-january\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">nine out of 10 college students believe that colleges have a mental health crisis</a>. Despite increased awareness about the importance of supporting mental health on college campuses, our conversations too often emphasize averting crises. Instead, we need proactive discussions focused on helping students develop the skills and habits to thrive in a fast-paced and complex world. We should start by reframing the topic from a “problem with our students” to a “problem with the historical moment in which our students live.” There is a lot to be anxious about today. We need to assure students that mental health challenges are not a personal failing but a reasonable response to a challenging historical moment when they are reading and hearing a lot about climate change, war in Europe, a global pandemic, political polarization, rampant inflation and declining social and political institutions. And we should recognize that the social isolation and anxiety many of our students are feeling is less about them as individuals and more about how Covid responses negatively impacted their lives during the past few years. Young people’s prolonged social isolation in the midst of learning to develop healthy social skills and negotiate responsibilities had profound negative impacts on both their physical and mental health. After acknowledging these stressors, the conversation needs to focus on helping students learn to positively impact their own health. While not all aspects of their mental health are under their control, students have more ownership than they realize. We should encourage candid conversations about the connection between physical and mental health. If students don’t sleep enough (and few do), eat nutritionally and stay active, they won’t be physically or mentally healthy. For example, one study found that <a href=\"https://aasm.org/insufficient-sleep-college-student-athletes/#:~:text=With%20every%20additional%20night%20of,functional%20problems%2C%20and%2028%25%20for\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">with every additional night of insufficient sleep, the risk of experiencing mental health symptoms increased by more than 20 percent</a>. We also need to have candid conversations about the connection between social media and <a href=\"https://www.affordablecollegesonline.org/college-resource-center/cyberbullying-awareness/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">increased levels of bullying</a>, harassment and <a href=\"https://grownandflown.com/10-ways-teens-college-students-cope-fomo/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">FOMO</a> (fear of missing out) and how this contributes to poor mental health. Too many students are using social media to find human connection instead of seeking out the face-to-face interactions that build strong relationships and are critical to well-being and development. Most importantly, we need to introduce concepts like emotional agility and mindfulness into our campus conversations. <a href=\"https://www.susandavid.com/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard professor Susan David</a> talks about how the way we engage our emotions shapes our mental health. We can help students develop the tools to recognize anxiety and depression as feelings that are real but not fixed. I love this quote from her: “When we show up fully, with awareness and acceptance, even the worst demons usually back down.” We need to help students understand that suffering is deeply human, and that we can learn to accept it, move through it and emerge more substantial and resilient. Research done by the <a href=\"https://www.mindandlife.org/about/#mission\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Mind &amp; Life Institute</a> and other organizations should guide campuswide conversations about how to transform everything from <a href=\"https://mindrxiv.org/nx8v4/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">teaching to residential halls to crisis management</a> in ways that foster students’ development of the skills and habits of well-being. We also need to set reasonable and realistic expectations for students about the college experience. <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/dr_tim_bono_how_can_we_solve_the_college_student_mental_health_crisis\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Bono</a> at Washington University has been rightly critical of our college admissions process that paints an unrealistic picture for incoming students. Colleges need to describe the whole college experience — including its challenges and demands. While there are many fun moments, there are also times of loneliness, struggle and failure. By design, college delivers profound personal growth, and this happens through overcoming obstacles and developing tools to succeed. We should not be afraid to challenge students out of fear that it will have a detrimental impact on their mental health. The greatest gift we can give young people is a “push,” because it sends the message that we believe in them and that they can rise to the occasion. Brandon Slade of <a href=\"https://untappedlearning.com/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Untapped Learning</a> recently said to me, “Too often, colleges are all support and no accountability or all accountability and no support. The best colleges understand that students need two parts support to one part accountability.” The experience of recovering from setbacks and hardships is something we need throughout our lives. College campuses are good places for students to learn and practice getting up over and over again to achieve more than they think is possible. Finally, we need a conversation about medical care on our campuses. We need to clarify what our campuses can and cannot provide, and we need to allow students with existing medical providers to continue to receive care virtually. The time is right for colleges to explore new partnerships to expand the medical care we offer. We also need to be honest with students about when it might be wise to take a semester off. Sometimes students need to give themselves permission to step away from college, focus on their health and then return when they are healthy and ready to continue. When I look across our campuses, I see a generation of students who are intent on addressing the issues of their time. Colleges can prepare them to meet those challenges, but we need a better conversation about who we are, what we do and how we help students develop the capacity to thrive in their personal and professional lives. Weinberg and Davis discuss a program that teaches students about civil discourse before they step foot into a college classroom. Denison is committed to specific immediate and long-term actions to fight against and eliminate racism on our campus. Pres. Weinberg makes the case in Kiplinger that there’s never been a better time for students &amp; recent grads to make new connections &amp; develop skills. ",

Her idea of quality television was watching “The Mythbusters.” So as Engler ’25 progressed through her first year at Denison University, the biochemistry major wondered whether she could spend her summer doing something more than teaching swim lessons and lifeguarding at her home in Charlottesville, Va. She found her answer through Denison’s Summer Scholars program. “I realized I was really interested in the research aspect of science,” she said. “I wanted to go further and learn what research was like because it’s something I want to consider for my future.” Each summer, endowed funds support 120 to 140 students pursuing research under the supervision of a faculty member for up to 10 weeks, said Suzanne G. Shoger, administrative director of the Lisska Center for Intellectual Engagement. Scholars receive a stipend and a housing allowance, and those who travel off campus for their projects also receive travel funding. In 2022, one student went to Southeast Asia to study the perils and instability of the film industry in Vietnam. Another group journeyed to Ireland to examine an excavation site with the goal of identifying how indigenous people responded to the Anglo-Norman conquest in the 12th century. On-campus projects included a look at the Islamic transformation in the post-Soviet Tajikistan and the rise of populism in French political culture. The Council on Undergraduate Research has recognized Denison as a leader in the field with the organization’s award for Undergraduate Research Accomplishments. For Engler, the Summer Scholar experience meant five weeks working in the labs of associate professor Christine Weingart. Engler is an eighth-generation Denisonian. One famous relative has a residence hall named in honor of them — Dr. Daniel Shepardson, the former president of the Young Ladies Institute, which merged with Denison in 1927. Family tradition aside, Engler says it was the school’s intimate setting and small class sizes that drew her to central Ohio. It was, however, sage advice from her uncle, Jackson D. Pellett ’95, that led her down a path to the Summer Scholars program. “He was the one who told me about all the opportunities here, and he emphasized the importance of going to office hours and getting to know my professors,” Engler said. “(After Summer Scholars), I feel like I’ve gotten to know Dr. Weingart on a more personal level.” Outfitted in a white lab coat, Engler spent five days a week taking copious notes and working alongside several upperclassmen. She lost count of how many pairs of blue disposable gloves she wore to guard against contamination. “Abby’s enthusiasm, her genuine curiosity, and her desire to learn helped move the scientific knowledge of Burkholderia cenocepacia forward,” Weingart said. “Her contribution will play an important role in our future work.” Although her project is not graded, Engler must summarize her work and present her findings in posterboard form when classes resume for the fall semester. “Some people will go into research like this and realize this isn’t what they want, so it has benefits both ways no matter what you take out of it,” Engler said. “I’ve liked the research even more than I thought I would. It’s something I will consider as a future career path.” ",

Accommodations can include additional time on exams, testing in a separate setting, and access to technology reduces barriers to learning that are often experienced by these students. Bittner analyzed data from the U.S. Department of Education to examine students’ access to accommodations over the past decade. She found that although access to accommodations increased over time, this increase was seen predominantly in America’s most expensive and private institutions. For example, accommodations increased by 162% at the eight Ivy League schools and 292% at the top eight liberal arts colleges identified by <em>U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. In contrast, students’ access to accommodations at most community and technical colleges remained low and stable over time. “Our findings indicate that students with disabilities who are most in need of academic support are least likely to receive it,” Bittner says. “Social and economic factors should not hinder a student’s ability to obtain necessary accommodations.” Bittner and Weis presented their information directly to people who work in university disability offices at professional conferences in Chicago and Cleveland. “I appreciated sharing this research with people who can relate to these issues,” she says. “Sharing our findings with people who can actually use this information to help students with disabilities was extremely rewarding.” Bittner enjoyed the balance between mentorship and autonomy during her summer scholar experience. “My faculty advisor and I worked together through each step of the research process. I had the opportunity to complete each part of the project on my own and then received help and feedback from my advisor. This combination of freedom, structure, and support was really beneficial for my learning.” “This project furthered my belief in the importance of psychological research. It helped solidify my plans to work as a research assistant after graduation and pursue an advanced degree in psychology in the future.” Read the results of the study and other findings from the <a href=\"http://neuropsychology.denison.edu/\" class=\"external-link\" target=\"_blank\">Denison Neuropsychology Lab</a>.
