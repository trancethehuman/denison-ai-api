    "content": "Sarah Carpenter, Opinion Editor— In recent years, misinformation has become an ever-increasing threat to the fabric of society. In a time where we live through “unprecedented” events every day, finding accurate and reliable information is imperative. Although vast amounts of information is readily available at our fingertips, it is easier than ever to spread misleading and inaccurate information to millions across the globe. As “discerning moral agents” it is critical that we seek out the truth through credible, evidence based resources. Each one of us experienced first-hand the consequences of misinformation during the Covid-19 pandemic. From the beginning, there was a flood of false and misleading information about the virus, including conspiracy theories about the origin of the virus, false claims about the effectiveness of certain treatments, and misinformation about the safety and efficacy of vaccines. As a result, many lost faith in the credibility of various health organizations and were distrusting of evidence backed facts. Many Americans did not take the necessary steps to protect themselves, prolonging the pandemic and further emphasizing the need for credible information. More recently; however, has been the spread of information regarding the East Palestine train derailment, which happened only 150 miles away from Denison’s campus. Only a few days ago I heard two students having a conversation about the disaster, in which one claimed that the derailment could have easily been prevented through a regulation requiring electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes on highly flammable trains. Although seemingly a valid argument, the source that the student cited in their argument was none other than TikTok. Upon further research, I found that the regulation in question would only apply to high hazard flammable trains. The train that derailed was classified as a mixed freight train, meaning it would not have had the aforementioned brakes even with the regulation in place. Anyone can fall victim to misinformation, and this is a perfect example. Had I listened to what they were saying without doing my own research, I would have believed them and unknowingly contributed to the perpetuation of inaccurate claims. In many cases, false and misleading information is often deliberately spread by individuals or groups with a specific agenda. These individuals or groups have a vested interest in promoting a certain viewpoint or ideology, and they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals. This can include anything from creating fake news stories to utilizing social media outlets to falsify data. These groups capitalize on the fear and uncertainty of people to further their own agenda, and it is our job to disarm them. It is important to acknowledge that the problem of misinformation is complex and multifaceted and that there is no one easy solution; however, we can all take small steps to fight against false information. Because I am only a student at a small liberal arts college, I want to plead to you to use the critical thinking skills that our prestigious college teaches you. Although social media is a great way to share information when used correctly, make sure you look into things. A simple internet search can tell you whether the information you have received is false or not. I beg you to take five minutes out of your day to fact-check the information you get during your morning TikTok scroll or Twitter feed check. Misinformation has become a pervasive problem in today’s digital age and with it come dire consequences. At its worst, it can put people’s lives at risk. For example, misinformation about vaccines or treatments can lead people to make harmful decisions about their health. In politics, it can undermine public trust in institutions and fuel conspiracy theories, leading to social unrest. Stopping the spread of misinformation starts with each of us, so I ask you to be part of the solution to build a more informed, knowledgeable, and engaged world.",

    "content": "Lula Burke, Editor-in-Chief— Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking to my friend Sarah in the library. We had a wonderful conversation about her trip abroad, our summer research interests, and our weekend plans. Sarah is the same major as me, and inevitably, our conversation hit a sour note. I remember her saying, “The environment is so important to me. How do other people not feel that?” Environmental science is a passion that I didn’t know I had. In a single two-hour oceanography class, my entire college career fell into place. This was what I had been missing in my political science classes. This was the “emptiness” I felt in philosophy. It was real; It was tangible. This passion can sometimes be a horrible sickness. Every styrofoam cup and plastic fork makes me sick to my stomach. I have been brought to tears thinking about the exhaust from my car. When I can’t make coffee in my room, I torture myself with a RedBull solely because aluminum is infinitely recyclable. When I had a terrible case of food poisoning, I still made myself take the stairs up to my third-floor apartment. The point of this is not that individual consumer actions are going to fix all of our environmental issues–We know that is not true. The point of this is that I am infuriated by a sense of carelessness on our campus. You hope to work on Wall Street, but asking for a greenie is “too much work”? You major in philosophy, but “who cares! Out of sight, out of mind.” Do you have this mindset when you’re reading Descartes or researching the housing crisis? God, I hope not. To me, this carelessness represents something even more sinister: Environmentalism has turned into somewhat of a joke. Freshman year, one of my friends purposefully selected a new plastic cup every time he wanted water at dinner, solely because it made me mad. What is the purpose of that? It represents something deeper. To many, it seems that climate and waste issues are detached from everyday life. Does this detachment affect your other interests? I hope that these individuals are prospering in their respective studies. During my time at Denison, I’ve seen a loss of passion. Maybe I’ve just grown older, and my classmates have grown more tired and more ready to move onto the next stage of life. I hope that students feel sick to their stomachs about investigative journalism and biochemistry. Making the world a better place is the work of politicians, artists, scientists, philosophers and individuals. However, our environment is at the heart of it all. You cannot be progressive without acknowledging the importance of our environment in every facet of our lives. How will you possibly succeed in life if the smallest of personal tasks is too much Work? Who are you, if you don’t care?",

    "content": "Tait Ferguson, Special to <em>The Denisonian</em>— If you’ve listened to a recent stump speech from President Adam Weinberg, you probably hear him mention that Denison is a place where you’ll have friends across the political spectrum. I agree whole-heartedly with President Weinberg’s sentiment that Denison should be a place where students are exposed to a variety of viewpoints and learn how to communicate across these differences. Yet, anyone who watched the debate between the Denison Democratic Socialists of America and the Denison Libertarians is likely feeling much more cynical about the President’s call to action. Instead of being a constructive conversation where students debate, listen, and learn, the “debate” was dominated by Yik-Yak one-liners. Don’t get me wrong, I am excited to see an effort to actually have moderated partisan dialogues across differences, but students still lack a motivation to build healthy and constructive spaces for partisan disagreements that will lead to a more informed and community-focused campus. One of the most important roles of a college education is to expose students to a variety of opinions and foster spaces where they can listen and develop informed viewpoints. Not to mention, dialogue across differences can help build empathy, which research has shown is the most important skill for fostering innovation, engagement, and inclusivity among leaders and teams (Brower 2021). The Lisska Center, CLIC, and DU Votes have worked for years to try and make this vision a concrete reality on campus, but students must step up to the plate. Students need to take the initiative to help build constructive spaces to have partisan conversations, be willing to actively listen to their peers, and not be afraid to alter (or completely change) ideas they came to Denison believing. Two changes are essential if Denison students are to live up to President Weinberg’s charge. First, Students should join (and lead) more partisan organizations on campus. Currently, partisan groups on campus have virtually no visibility, and don’t do enough to engage the campus in critical issues. We need spaces on campus where students can come to engage in a wide variety of partisan ideas and solutions. Importantly, partisan organizations offer Denisonians the opportunity to learn from perspectives different from their own, often from friends, peers, or co-workers. With a variety of well-attended and well-led partisan organizations, students will be able to engage with the nuances of political ideologies and develop political ideologies that they can be confident in. Moreover, the Denison Libertarians, College Democrats, and College Republicans barely run any campus events that engage students in dialogic partisan conversations, yet the clubs received over a combined $56,000 from 2022-2023 DCGA club funds. If their job is to encourage a healthy and consistent partisan dialogue, and they have the money to do it, why aren’t there a wealth of events doing just that? Second, where spaces for partisan conversation do exist, students need to be committed to practicing empathy and listening. This class of 2026’s August Orientation included a Braver Angles debate on free speech as a stellar example of healthy dialogue on difficult issues. Students and faculty gave competing, but informed and respectful perspectives on a heated issue. Partisan organizations on campus should aim to create opportunities for leaders to present a variety of viewpoints where students can openly engage. Importantly, students engaging in conversations on partisan issues should come to the space ready to learn from their peers. This doesn’t mean you must always change your mind, but you should be willing to hear the other side.",

    "content": "Genevieve Pfister, Staff Writer— On Feb. 6, a new on-campus Physical Therapy Clinic opened its doors to Denison students, faculty, staff, and members of the Granville community. The clinic, located in Room 136 of the Mitchell Center, is part of Denison’s larger partnership with the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, which was announced in April of 2022, and aims to improve and promote wellness across Denison’s campus. The physical therapy clinic offers access to therapists “specializing in the comprehensive care of musculoskeletal conditions involving bones, muscles, and joints, including orthopedic and sports medicine injuries,” according to the program announcement. The clinic is managed by Joann Walker, a practicing physical therapist at OSU, and staffed by herself and fellow OSU physical therapist Lei Zhang, with a third therapist, Zach Webster, scheduled to start later on. All have doctorates in physical therapy and experience in strength, conditioning, and physical therapy practice. “[The clinic] can treat any and every kind of musculoskeletal condition that’s necessary,” Walker said. “So that’s anything where you might have a muscle strain, or back pain or knee surgery, anything along that scope [and]. . . far beyond that scope.” She explained that the use of the term musculoskeletal in this context refers to conditions relating to the human movement system and human movement and function in general. This is slightly different to the area of expertise offered through Denison’s Sports Medicine services, though the two are complementary and work in tandem with one another. Services at the clinic are generally geared toward healthy, physically active community members who are experiencing musculoskeletal issues and are eager to improve their strength and range of motion. Appointments at the clinic typically last between 45 minutes to an hour and include an initial evaluation appointment, during which therapists conduct a head-to-toe examination to determine the source of the pain. Then, therapists will work with patients to develop a treatment plan, including a schedule of additional appointments and exercises to do at home. During each subsequent appointment, therapists will check in with patients to evaluate progress and determine what parts of the plan need adjustment. Amy Ehrlich, Program Manager for the Denison- Ohio State Relationship, explained that the idea for the physical therapy clinic came up early in discussions between the two universities about what the partnership would look like. Both colleges, she said, had shared interests in promoting community wellness, and were eager to work together to identify resources that OSU could provide to meet the needs of the Denison community. Physical therapy, alongside behavioral therapy and other wellness services, was identified as one of these key resources. In an email from April 13, 2022, President Weinberg cited physical therapy as “one of the services most requested by our students.” Both Ehrlich and Walker stressed that the program is designed to serve both athletes and non-athletes; anyone experiencing musculoskeletal issues or pain is welcome to come for evaluation, and therapists are happy to work with patients in whatever way they feel comfortable. Ehrlich and Walker also emphasized the value of taking a multi-disciplinary and collaborative approach to the program, with Denison and OSU staff across different areas coming together to make the program a reality. “We would also be remiss if we did not thank Denison for the privilege and honor to be on campus and to deliver this care, and to get the clinic set up,” Ehrlich added. “It was a real team effort… We had lots of folks on the Denison campus that helped us do that… and it’s just been amazing from start to finish.” The clinic is open Mondays and Wednesdays from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M., Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M., and Fridays from 9 A.M. to 3 P.M. Appointments can be booked by calling 614-814-8658. Fees for therapy will be charged to each patient’s insurance provider, and patients should check with their providers for questions about cost and what is covered.",

    "content": "Pol Le, News Editor— Doobie Radio recently created the new 24-Hour Doobie Takeover Event that featured DASU (Denison Asian Student Association), Green Team, DISA (Denison International Student Association), and Outlook. The event was spearheaded by Henry Gamble ‘24, who reached out to different organizations and planned the logistics of the event. “[Doobie’s] executive team was trying to figure out how we can collaborate more with organizations outside our usual shows.” Station Manager Kat Amiet ’23 said. The takeover was split into two 12-hour sessions between 9 am – 9 pm on both Saturday, the 25th and Sunday, the 26th of February. Their station is housed in a cozy corner of Slayter’s first floor, highlighted by colorful posters in purple, yellow, and pink. Each organization had its members sign up for slots of thirty minutes. They then met up with a Doobie DJ in the station and learned how to stream on the radio. “It’s really all up to the members who are coming in. We might interview them a little bit at the beginning and then we will see how it goes,” Amiet said. “Our DJ could be like ‘Hey, do you want to talk about your organization?,’ ‘Do you want to talk about any events that are coming up?,’ or ‘Do you want to talk about what your organization’s mission is?’” It took around a month to plan the show. The executive team was also mindful of the Burpee’s 24-hour show and the Bandersnatch’s 24-hour event, all of which happened on the same weekend. “It was really busy for everyone, which is why we’re so grateful that people find the time to be able to have this collaboration with us,” Amiet said. Hoa Tran ‘25, a DASU member, was paired with Joselin Aguilar Gramajo, a mentor from the Doobie Radio executive board. Tran was able to navigate the “board”, which controls the volume of all the mics, the computers, and the speakers in Slayter. They decided to play one of his custom Japanese playlists instead of doing an interview. “You don’t have to talk. You can just play music,” Tran said. Soham Changani’ 23, the President of DISA, used the Doobie platform to talk about his experience as an international student. When first arriving at Denison, Soham wasn’t necessarily culture-shocked, as he had visited the U.S several times prior. Yet he still did notice differences. “Orientation has changed a lot since I was freshman,” Changani said. “Orientation was only for international students. Because of that, you were limited to making international friends. Whereas now orientation has changed and it’s open for everyone.” He was having this conversation with Gamble, who is a Doobie DJ. The pair went on to discuss the social gaps that they often observed between international and domestic students, noting that bridging large cultural differences may seem daunting to some, but is always rewarding. For the rest of his segment, Changani and Sham D Khuseynov ‘23 listened to Russian music. Khuseynov said that he didn’t think people often hear the Doobie playing a Russian playlist, his favorite type of music. The Doobie Radio team said they are hoping that this takeover series will become a frequent event that takes place once or twice per semester. Some organizations have already reached out to show their interest in being part of the next 24-hour show. “I feel like it’s nice because we had different people coming in,” Amiet said.",

    "content": "Micah Stromsoe DeLorenzo, Special to <em>The Denisonian</em> “Naked Week” is a popular Denison tradition in which students who choose to participate strip naked or nearly-naked and essentially just run around campus. It’s advertised as a celebration of body positivity and the Denison student body’s way of participating in Eating Disorder Awareness Week. From the moment I heard about this tradition, I thought the entire event was backwards and counterintuitive, and the more I’ve learned about it the more my opinion solidifies. Now, it’s not that I’m against Naked Week altogether. If it brings people joy, then I support it. But the implication that an event like this would have any positive contribution to eating disorder awareness is frankly upsetting. Eating disorders are so much more than being ashamed of your body and attaching this event to such a serious mental health issue not only trivializes it but borders on dismissing it altogether. Personally, I’ve never participated in Naked Week, and I don’t necessarily have any interest in doing so. But this hasn’t stopped people from asking me to participate, making jokes about why I don’t want to, and trying to convince me of how fun it is. This creates an environment of pressure, and I know I’m not the only person who’s felt it. For someone in recovery, or actively struggling with an eating disorder, this pressure could have devastating consequences; an already laborious mental health journey becomes that much more difficult. Say I finally give in and decide to participate. Even if the environment is as uplifting and fun as everyone has told me it’s going to be, how is that going to stop me from comparing my body to all the ones around me? An environment where you’re surrounded by people you perceive as perfectly confident in their bodies, where you can compare even more details than you could before, is not necessarily going to be productive for someone who has struggled with an eating disorder. This body comparison comes up even if you don’t choose to participate, because it’s a public event. On the first day, naked bodies will be running through A Quad, the most central and populated part of campus. All of those bodies will be opportunities for unhealthy comparison and self-hatred. There will also be examples of people who are more confident, and perhaps even braver than oneself. And even if there’s no comparison, even if the peer pressure that surrounds this event is disregarded, one major red flag still stands: Naked Week turns body positivity into a performance. This isn’t an issue of the actual performance itself– it’s an issue of context. Eating disorders are a deeply personal and complicated issue. They’re nuanced, and individualized, and many of them are battles fought alone. Turning your “support” into a performance belittles the genuine devastation that eating disorders bring. People lose their lives to these disorders, and as glad as I am that people feel empowered by running around naked, this has nothing to do with the issue it claims to raise awareness about. Naked Week in itself isn’t a terrible event. But while there could be some merit in the argument that it celebrates body positivity, pretending it’s a positive contribution to eating disorder awareness does more harm than good.",

    "content": "Robert Neithart, Asst. News Editor— About a month ago, I had one of the worst nightmares I’ve experienced in recent memory. I woke up at around 6:30 am with a strikingly detailed recollection of the dream I’d just had. I then proceeded to cry intermittently until my 8:30 am philosophy class, where, as if to throw salt into the wound, we discussed the nature of dreams and whether they truly represent a separate reality. In the dream, one of my siblings had passed away, and my remaining family and I had to deal with the crushing reality of continuing life minus one of our most beloved. The shock and ensuing reflection prompted me to text “Love you guys” to my sibling group chat, a rare occurrence and a stark departure from most of my emotional expression which is usually delivered under a not-so-subtle veneer of sarcasm. I thought a lot about my dream in the following days and weeks, growing increasingly disappointed that it took such an extreme occurrence to express my love and care for those so close to me. Why was it that I needed a once-in-a-decade nightmare to provide the motivation to express something that I should be saying on a regular basis? The answer is that confronting mortality, in whatever respect, has a remarkable way of providing clarity into the priorities of one’s life. Rarely do individuals on their deathbeds express regret for not having bought more stuff, earned more money, or secured a higher position at their law firm. Rather, it’s the emotional, relationship-oriented aspects of life that people regret missing out on. In my case, an early morning nightmare provided me with a reminder of the transience of life and my relationships. Confronting the prospect of permanent loss is a painful reality to reckon with, though one that proved necessary for me to take stock of my life and the people with whom I share it. Today it seems, death is somewhat of a taboo subject. People would rather bury their existential fears among the many stimuli with which we are so often occupied. Though this makes sense, it is an unfortunate reality considering the benefits one might enjoy from taking a few moments out of their day to consider their and others’ mortality. As young people, we often lead our lives under the illusory understanding that we’re invulnerable, at least for the next couple of decades, and thus, death shouldn’t be a real concern. While this perspective might be valid in terms of general health, death can come at any time, in any form and entirely indiscriminately. I don’t make this point for the purpose of dwelling on a harsh truth, rather, I say it because it’s important to acknowledge that tomorrow is never guaranteed and that this reality should inform our choices so that the way we act today reflects the image of the individual we’d like to be remembered as once we’ve moved on. Though we can never truly know what awaits us at the end of the road, what is clear is that death represents an end to this life. Consider for a moment how you’d be remembered if you were to pass on in your sleep. What would people say? What would you regret? Let that image instruct the person you want to be, never take tomorrow for granted and remember that a wasted day is a high price to pay.",

    "content": "Henry Gamble, News Editor— The Burpee’s Seedy Theatrical Company, known commonly as the Burpees, are the nation’s oldest collegiate improv group, with roots dating back to 1979. This year, the comedy troupe raised over $1,000 for the Ronald McDonald House Charity Foundation. According to the group’s website, the Burpees originated as a theater class taught by Professor Kevin Hoggard, and within the next year, students such as Steve Carrel ‘84 auditioned and joined the group. Since then, the Burpees have created what are now long-established traditions, such as the Out With the Old and In With the New Show, the Big Red Weekend Show, and the 24-Hour Show, the latest of which occurred this past weekend in Herrick Hall. This semester’s 24-Hour show will be the last for the group’s three Seniors, Ellie Laird ‘23, Tait Ferguson ‘23, and Sam Wyckoff ‘23. For all three improvises, time spent with the Burpees has been an incredibly meaningful experience. Laird emphasized the importance of the group when she explained that, “ I was planning to transfer from Denison my freshman year, and the Burpees at that time really were a big part of the reason I stayed, because of the friendships and bonds that we had, I knew that when I came back as a sophomore that they were going to be there.” For Ferguson, there was never any intention of being a Burpee. After an interaction at a tabling event, he decided to audition – a decision which he said has allowed him to interact with people he never would have otherwise. As the President of the group, W y k c o f f said that the Burpees have “shaped my time at Denison, in many different ways, especially, socially, but also in different ways, this year, especially in a leadership role.” When asked about the skills they will take with them, Laird, Ferguson and Wyckoff had a plethora of answers. For Ferguson, the ability to put himself in uncomfortable situations at times was valuable and a skill that he thinks will allow him to take up more opportunities in the future. Laird connected her time with the Burpees with the career in film and TV she hopes to pursue. She added, “in everyday life, it’s helped me just get by, with things that maybe I should have prepared a bit more for.” Time spent with the group has helped Wcykoff create what he called, “the out-on-a-limb philosophy,” which for him embodies the improvisational, comedic, and adventurous spirit of the Burpees. More than anything, Laird, Ferguson, and Wyckoff spoke of the relationships they have found throughout their time in the Burpees. Looking forward to their graduation, the trio expressed gratitude for the friends made along the way.",

    "content": "Ellie Owen, Arts &amp; Life Editor— Abby Valentine’s connection to Denison started when her dad discovered a random town in central Ohio that seemed like the perfect place for a surprise proposal. He didn’t know anything about the University that gazed down at the town from its spot on the hill. He wanted a place to propose to his then girlfriend that would surprise her, someplace she would never expect. So they drove out in the middle of a blizzard and he popped the question right in front of Swasey chapel. “I think the family history part definitely makes it an extra special place,” Valentine said. Fast forward more than two decades and now Abby Valentine is spending her second year working as the Assistant Director of First-Year Experience after graduating from Denison in 2021 with a degree in Spanish and Psychology. Her experience working in the first-year office started when she was just a sophomore feeling lost and disappointed. She was upset after not getting a job as an August or June orientation leader but was still seeking a position that would be meaningful to her. She immediately found her place at the first-year office, where her responsibilities included greeting students, talking to people on the phone and answering emails. In 2021, the woman who previously held Valentine’s position decided to leave and so she immediately asked to be considered for the job. “Well Abby, when she was a student, was like the most super reliable, attentive to detail student that we had to the point where it was easy to treat her like another member of the office,” said First-Year Program Coordinator Kate Tull. Valentine was initially only going to work through June orientation but excelled at her job and was invited to stay on for longer. “She did such a great job that they extended her contract and now she’s just a full-blown assistant director,” said Tull. And now she’s found herself working at Denison for much longer than she originally expected. “At first it was supposed to be a year and then it turned into a second year,” she said. She noted that she used to look down on people who worked at Denison immediately after graduation, but now understands the importance of her job and the opportunities it will provide for her in the future. She likes that she’s saving money and living at home but still often finds it strange that she’s now working at Denison after spending so much time as a student here. “Here I am now, in a different chapter of my life but in the same place and feeling like I have grown a lot but what does it mean if I’ve grown a lot but I’m still in the same place?” she asked. Yet, she’s still found lots to love about her work here. When asked what her favorite part of the job was, Valentine immediately mentioned all the people she gets to work with. “I’ve just always associated Denison with really awesome people,” she said about her colleagues who include Tull and First-Year Dean Nathan Graves. “And Nathan, who is my boss, has been this really incredible mentor to me. He’s the reason I’ve been able to grow in the ways that I have.” “We’re often spitballing ideas and then I help her kind of act on those so that we can kinda coordinate what that event needs to look like, or help her as she’s meeting with student leaders.” Graves said about their work together. As for her future, Abby Valentine doesn’t see her position at Denison as a long-term endeavor and instead considers it to be a good foundation for future jobs. She’s planning to say goodbye to Denison this September and has a job lined up in Barcelona. She’ll be working for a study abroad company called Alba. Valentine isn’t sure what her dream job is, but she knows it involves being in Spain. She did a study abroad program in Seville during her junior year and fell in love with the country. “My dream is more like… I want to be in Spain, I’ll do whatever it takes to be in Spain,” she said. “People talk about [how] they want to retire there and I kind of view it as the world’s on fire, I want to do what I want while I can. I don’t want to live my life waiting until I retire, that just seems really depressing!” Valentine had found lots of support while working at Denison but has also been very immersed in hustle culture. Her ambition all throughout high school and college has led her to work hard without thinking about what she’s working towards. Her job in the first-year office has felt like an extension of that busy lifestyle. Valentine noted that she was always scared of the future and plugged away in her routine and it didn’t hit until she was working forty hours a week at a real job that this routine might not be right for her anymore. She hopes her life in Spain will be more relaxing and those workaholic cultural norms will be different. “I would much prefer to live my life with my friends and my family as my number one priority and not work. I know I’m so driven to achieve stuff, like that’s what I focus on so if I’m in an environment that prioritizes that, that’s what I’m gonna do,” Valentine said. Her goodbye to Denison will be bittersweet as it closes the door to an important time period in her life and opens the door to great new experiences elsewhere.",

    "content": "Rev. Timothy Carpenter, Special to <em>The Denisonian</em>— As one of the longest Black male faculty and definitely one of the oldest, I have seen a lot. When I arrived on campus in the role of an accompanist for the then, “Gospel Choir,” I could not help but recognize the number of students of color. Frankly, I didn’t see that many. Now before you go “off” thinking that this article is about race, let me set the record straight. Though the title of my comments is called, “Reclaiming the SOUL of Denison,” and my first sentence does acknowledge my “blackness,’ one must see and understand that the word soul is the focus, of this article and that soul is not synonymous with race. The Encyclopedia Britannica defines soul as “…the immaterial aspect or essence of a human being, that which confers individuality and humanity, often considered synonymous with the mind or the self.” What does that mean in plain language? Soul is that part of each of us that expresses itself in many different and unique ways. That expression cannot be copied or transferred. Soul is incomparable. Your soul, your expression. Now do you see, there is no reference of race associated with soul. No one group has a monopoly on soul. Now Rev, what are you driving at? Well, I’ll tell you. We have commonly celebrated soul as a cultural possession of a singular group. I must confess, growing up in the era of movies like, “Sweet Sweet-back’s Baadasssss Song,” “Superfly” and “Shaft,” and TV shows like, “Sanford and Son,” “Good Times” and “The Jeffersons,” there was a cultural insinuation that soul was only an expression of blackness. I get it! But because of this exclusivity so many will real soul have been robbed of the opportunity to be recognized as genuine “Soul Brothas and Soul Sistas.” “You Better Recognize!” This was not the case when I first arrived on campus. Sure, there were some that held closely to their respective cultures and beliefs exclusively, but collectively this campus had soul. So much soul! I regularly attended Asian meetings and events. They had soul. I would attend African meetings and events. They had soul. I’d hang with White athletes at lunch. They had soul. There was the “Circle of Color” that met informally on the second floor of Slayter. They had soul. I shared in Jewish soul. And believe it or not, I also saw Atheist soul on display! There was LGBTQ+ soul. You did not have to look hard to find it. Soul was everywhere! Where has it gone? Where is the soul of Denison now? One of the vehicles that helped to promote that soul was the Denison University Gospel Choir. 90 some plus odd students. Black students, White students, Korean students, Vietnamese students, Indian students, Turkish students, Chinese students, Indigenous students and upon occasion, international exchange students all joining together to create such an amazing model of “soul.” So much soul that everyone that experienced them left the room on a “Soul High!” Where did it go? Where does one find soul on our campus now? If you have any idea… let me know!",

    "content": "Pol Le, News Editor— It’s finance season for Denison Council Government Association (DCGA). “The Division of Student Life has provided DCGA an annual allocation of $800,000 for campus organization budgets for the 2023-2024 academic year,” Dana Carnes Pursley, Director of the Alford Community Leadership and Involvement Center (CLIC), said. The DCGA Finance Committee’s goal is to review all budgets objectively, aligning with the DCGA Funding Rules which guide decision-making about the allocation and use of funds. The committee will have approximately eight hours of meetings per week for five weeks or until they have reviewed all budgets and made allocation decisions. The committee has not amended or changed the DCGA Funding Rules this academic year, and there are no new policies regarding how budgets are reviewed. The additional funding will come from DCGA’s Reserve Fund, of which the maximum budget allocation is $250,000 for this fiscal year. The Reserve Fund was created due to a surplus of funding that went unused by Denion’s student organizations. The committee is taking a more conservative approach this year, focusing on being fiscally responsible and creating a culture where campus leadership groups are utilizing funds effectively. The committee is looking at how organizations spend money to judge whether they will be allocated the same amount in the next year. “If a club spends $2,000 on events in one year but only spends $1,000 on events the following year, the committee may decide to cut the budget down to $1,000 for the next academic year.” Kelvin Giathinh Phan ‘25, a member of the Finance Committee said. Phan gave advice that organizations should be specific in their proposals and avoid lump sums, which could indicate poor financial planning. The committee is committed to ensuring that campus life stays consistent and that financial planning is a top priority.",

    "content": "Aaron Skubby, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus— For Mac Hammett ‘23, the newly constructed swingset between Silverstein and Good Hall is a cemented legacy that the Hammett family was at Denison. Hammett knew from the first time that his dad brought him to Denison that it was somewhere he wanted to be. His parents, William and Tamara Hammett, both attended the University, graduating in 1986 and 1987. Hammett was the driving force advocating for the swingset. He first heard murmurs of a swingset the spring of his sophomore year, and loved the idea. “I at one point got down on my knees in front of DCGA tabling and was practically begging for this thing to happen,” he said. The swingset idea didn’t pick up steam until Hammett returned from a semester abroad as a DCGA co-governor. During a Zoom conversation with the Student Life office, Hammett suggested the swingset. Associate Vice President Julie Tucker reached out to Hammett to learn more about the idea. “I was really thinking about what wellness meant,” Hammett said. “To have a space to relax, to have a space where you can collaborate with your friends, to just hang out and be. And you can’t do homework on a swing because you’re busy swinging.” Tucker tasked Hammett to research other campuses that have swingsets and see how projects were handled. He then met with facilities staff to discuss potential locations. He took these findings back to DCGA to discuss funding. The project ended up being paid for from DCGA’s reserve fund. The reserve fund is a fund that has accumulated from leftover money not used by student organization budgets. It is a potential resource for capital projects that enhance the student experience in some way. The swingset ended up costing around $50,000, a much lower price than Hammett’s initial estimates. While the foundation was built over winter break, the bench swings were finally attached on February 6. “My favorite thing is to walk by and see 9 or 10 people gathered around, and seeing people actually use it,” Hammett said. Hammett did face skeptics during the process who questioned whether or not the swing was necessary, but Hammett is confident that the results show that students enjoy it. “I actually had one student come up to me and say ‘Mac, I did not believe in this project. I thought it was stupid and it was a waste of money. And then I sat on the swing and I saw how important it was,’” he said. Hammett’s mother passed away when he was two years old. Since then, her memory has inspired Hammett to be a leader on campus. He’s a HESS and Global Health double major, a community advisor, a senior class co-governor in DCGA, and much more. “She is a motivation for everything that I do. The phrase in my head is to make mom proud. And I think my mom would be very proud of me,” he said. While the swing may always have its skeptics, Hammett is clear on the meaning of the swing: “If someone sits on it and smiles for 10 minutes and gets an escape from a difficult day, then it was all worth it.”",

    "content": "Mike Maynard, Staff Writer— On June 24th, 2023, Bill Mason ‘57 will be inducted into his fourth athletic hall of fame: the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA). The Ohio Lacrosse Hall of Fame ‘96, Orange High School Hall of Fame ‘96, and the Denison Athletic Hall of Fame ‘97 are the three other esteemed groups where his contributions have been acknowledged. In the Ohio Lacrosse Hall of Fame, he is recognized in all four categories that warrant induction: as a player, a coach, an official, and a “Pioneer” of the sport. During his time at Denison, Mason was known to be a dual-sport athlete, but that wasn’t initially the case. He was only here for basketball when he first arrived at the university in 1953. At the time, an alumni from Cleveland had sponsored Mason to attend Denison. “Every year I send a scholar athlete from the greater Cleveland area to Denison, and I want to send you,” Mason said about the conversation that brought him to Granville. For his first two years at the university, Mason only pursued basketball. It was not until his junior year of college where he would be recruited to join the lacrosse team. Dr. Rick Jarrett, the Athletic Director at the time, was planning on starting a lacrosse program at Denison. “It was enjoyable,” Mason said. “I loved basketball but I wasn’t a shooter. I was a playmaker. If there had been a point guard back then, I would have been a point guard. But lacrosse captured all the things I loved about athletics.” The addition of lacrosse to his athletic repertoire came easy, racking up several accolades in his short collegiate career. In his senior year alone, Mason won MVP on the midwest championship team, was a All-Midwest Mid-field selection, and set a record of 38 consecutive controlled faceoffs. For Mason, that was only the beginning of his impact on the sport. Soon after graduating, he took on an assistant coaching role with the lacrosse team for the next ten years. After his stint in coaching, Mason spent the next 22 years as an lacrosse official.“I played it up until I was in my late 50’s,” Mason said. He was also part of starting the Columbus Lacrosse Club, where he both played and coached for a long time. But as he advanced in his career as an educator, maintaining his commitment to the club became more difficult. Mason also remained in the local Newark community after graduating from Denison. Between 1957 and 1997, Mason held several roles in education such as teaching, principal, superintendent, and a professor at Ohio State Newark. He additionally received several awards in his educational career during the late 80’s and early 90’s. Working with young people has been a long time passion of Mason. Just like the alumni who saw something in him, Mason carried on that same approach in life toward those who he could make a difference for. Denison Swimming Head Coach Gregg Parini saw that from Mason during the very first time they met. His son, Joe Parini, was a lacrosse player at Mason’s high school. In one of his first games he got thrown out of the game, and Parini has never forgotten what happened next. “He was pretty wound up on the sideline, then I watch this guy walk down to the end of the bench and put his arm around Joe. Within five minutes he had Joe calmed down,” Parini said. “So after the game I talked to Joe and I asked who was that?” Who was it? None other than volunteer coach Bill Mason. “That was my first introduction to Mace, and then I watched him the rest of the season and saw what a positive impact he had on the young men on that team,” Parini said. It was not long after that introduction that Parini was hiring for his own team at Denison. He called Bill Mason. “I offered him to come in and work as our strength coach,” Parini said. Mason’s athletic experience consisted of playing basketball and lacrosse. He did not know anything about coaching a swim team. But for Parini, it wasn’t about having knowledge in the sport itself. “He knew how to handle young men and women, I knew he was really good at it. That’s the kind of guy I want on my staff,” Parini said. Parini says Mason has a gift for working with young people. “He does a really good job of empowering the kids to go after their goals and they always feel supported,” Parini said. Mason has always been an encouraging presence regardless of the environment, whether it be in the weight room, the classroom, a board meeting, a sit down interview, or in a fraternal space. Sigma Chi President, Will Solis ‘25, knows Bill Mason from their interactions at the fraternity’s house, where Mason is the active house manager and a former member of the chapter during his college years. “When I met Bill, I just knew he was a total Denison guy,” Solis said. “[That] was really unique because there’s not many people I know who have been here as long as Bill has.” The brothers of Sigma Chi look up to Bill Mason. He is a valuable leader in their eyes. Mason has been able to connect with the fraternity men in a lot of ways, oftentimes being able to relate as they have members who are student-athletes. “He’s been through the exact same thing that we’ve been through or going through right now,” Solis said. Wherever Mason goes, he leaves his mark on those around him. The stories from the many individuals he has positively influenced over the years do not make it difficult to understand that Mason is a humble, considerate, and hard working person that believes in helping others, and consistently sees and brings the best out of people. Congratulations to Bill Mason on his upcoming induction into the Ohio High School Athletic Association Hall of Fame, the honor only scratches the surface of the interpersonal impact that his legacy embodies.",

    "content": "Patrick Fitzgerald, Special to <em>The Denisonian</em> Will Hunter ‘23, is the lone senior on the Denison Men’s Basketball team, an undoubtedly rare situation for a student-athlete.&nbsp; “It was fun and stressful at the same time –as a leader and a figure on the team,” Hunter said. He also mentioned that it was fun to have a lot of young guys on the team.&nbsp; Notably, five members of the team come from the class of 2026 and nine from the class of 2025. “There are moments where someone has to step up and say the hard things,” Hunter said, and he learned to embrace that. In regards to what pieces of advice he would say to the upcoming seniors, he said they should “find a way to lean on each other” in tough times and added that good leadership is heavily based in the “way you present things.” However, the point he would stress the most to them is to “get the guys to buy in early,” because it is really easy to lose the locker room if things go poorly and the team is not a cohesive unit. Hunter smiled when asked about what he’d tell his freshman self in retrospect. “Not to take it so seriously, and to spend more time enjoying it. Soaking in those memories,” he said. The highlight year for him was his sophomore year in 2020-21, the covid-shortened season. During that year, Hunter led the team in scoring with 11 points per game.&nbsp; “I wish it lasted a little longer, because I was playing pretty well,” Hunter said. He elaborated on the fact that they had gone through preseason as normal and then all of a sudden, the season was in doubt. They ended up only playing ten games. Hunter identified two stories as his favorite on and off-court memories in his four years at Denison. He was quick to mention his first game at Earlham back in November of 2019 as one that stood out.&nbsp; He said he was “jittery” and nervous. He ended with ten points on 3-5 shooting and laughed, also mentioning that he fouled out of the game. He said it was his favorite on-court memory because it is a benchmark on how far he had come since that moment.&nbsp; His favorite off-court memory with the team was when they traveled to San Francisco in December 2019. “Me and maybe seven other guys went on a hike for a day —[we] wandered the streets of Santa Cruz at night after we beat UC Santa Cruz,” Hunter said.&nbsp; As for goals for the rest of the season, Hunter said, “We just want to play the best we can.” Based on recent performances, they seem to be meeting that goal.&nbsp; We can’t know for sure if their form will continue into the NCAC Tournament, but the Denison Men’s team extended their conference winning streak to three games against Wabash on Wednesday, Feb 8. In what was Senior Day for Hunter, the Big Red and the Little Giants played a highly contested game where Denison came out on top 68-61.&nbsp; The Big Red won on the back of Darren Rubin ‘24’s 18 points and team-high four assists. A big disparity in the game was their 14 fast break points compared to Wabash’s one.&nbsp; Other notable players included Tyler Miller ‘25 with 13 points on 50% shooting from the field and Scotty Dean ‘25. Dean was all over the court, playing the top of the Big Red’s 1-3-1 defense while running back and forth.&nbsp; He came up with a huge steal and bucket with 5:18 left in the game and also sank a massive three-pointer with 4:05 left in the game to give them a five-point lead. When asked how they snapped the Wabash run in the first ten minutes of the second half, Dean said, “You just need one spark play, Tyler hit a big three that gave us some energy.”&nbsp; The sophomore guard was the epitome of energy in the last ten minutes of the game. In addition, speaking on what mentality he has to play with such intensity, he said, “Just go have fun, leave it all out there man. You can’t go back into that locker room thinking you left something out there.”&nbsp; On Saturday, Feb. 11, the Big Red’s winning streak, unfortunately, came to an end with a 78-61 loss at Ohio Wesleyan. They look to end the season off strong, facing Wooster and Kenyon in their final two regular-season matchups ahead of their first NCAC tournament game on Tuesday, Feb. 21.",

    "content": "Sarah Carpenter, Opinion Editor— When Zoe Hines ‘24 was asked to describe her college experience prior to&nbsp;her junior year she responded quickly&nbsp;with one word: “exhausting.” “I was looking forward to the college experience so much, but I became more de-pressed and overwhelmed than I ever have before,” Hines said. “Going into sophomore year, I was constantly trying-&nbsp;ing to find new ways to cope and motivate myself, but nothing was super effective. It became too much for me&nbsp;to handle and I knew I needed to find something new and specific for me.” After extensive research and discussion with family, friends, and counselors, they came up with a unique opinion: an emotional support dog. At the end of her sophomore year, Hines made the plunge and got her dog, Bentley. “After sophomore year, I really wasn’t doing well mentally and I had tried really everything else,” Hines stated. “I love animals and knew that it would be helpful, but the responsibility was intimidating.” Hines brought&nbsp;Bentley to school for the first time at&nbsp;the beginning of her junior year. “I was so nervous. I didn’t know how people would react to him and even though he is a new dog, I wasn’t sure how well he was going to adjust to this college setting or if it would be the best thing&nbsp;for him.” Although the benefits of emotional support animals have been contested, research has suggested they can be especially helpful for college students because of the high-stress environment that surrounds them. “I mean colleges know we’re stressed and always bring in therapy dogs, so it makes sense they would be super helpful on an individual level,” Hines said. A study done by the University of Main explored the use of therapy dogs on&nbsp;college campuses and demonstrated students who directly interacted with the dogs showed an uptick in mood, affirming the potential benefits of emotional support dogs. “When I walk him around campus I always have people&nbsp;coming up to me and saying hi. They&nbsp;always say that he [Bentley] has made their day better.” Bringing a dog to Denison’s campus;&nbsp;however, is an extremely involved pro- cess. According to Denison’s policy, students who wish to bring emotional&nbsp;support animals to campus must first&nbsp;have a diagnosis from their healthcare provider, register with ARC, and meet with different committees, to name a&nbsp;few. “There was so much paperwork to fill out just for Denison to consider&nbsp;allowing him here. I have to agree to be liable for all damage he causes and there’s a really long list of rules and regulations to follow,” Hines said. “I&nbsp;have to be extremely aware and careful with our surroundings at all times, it’s really intimidating.” Although the benefits of her emotional support dog far outweigh the drawbacks, Hines says that having a&nbsp;dog does have its difficulties. “Even&nbsp;though all my friends love Bentley, having people over in our apartment is always scary because there’s always the risk of people dropping stuff he could get or hurting him somehow,” Hines said. “It’s also hard to balance my class schedule and my Bentley schedule be- cause he requires so much care.” Regardless, Hines says it is all worth&nbsp;it for the joy and benefits Bentley has brought her. “The things I have learned&nbsp;about responsibility with him have easily transferred to my schoolwork and classes, so he, in a way, has made me a better student,” Hines says. “Bentley has made me a better person, and I love him so much for that.”&nbsp;",

    "content": "Robert Neithart, Asst. News Editor— A propensity to skepticism seems to be a common thread in humankind’s reception of new technology. From the Luddites of the 19th century and their resistance toward industrial advancement to the <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/03/when-people-feared-computers/388919/\">“computerphobia” of the early eighties</a>, people have often met new technologies with some combination of skepticism, fear and anxiety.&nbsp; Now, 39 years since the release of the first Macintosh and 16 years on from the first generation of Apple smartphones, in a decade wherein many of us have lived our entire lives surrounded by technology, we find ourselves in the curious position of judging what will likely be the next great frontier: artificial intelligence.&nbsp; What separates artificial intelligence or AI as it is commonly known, from past technologies is the extent to which it can emulate skillsets once thought to be unique to humans. AI’s unprecedented ability to replicate human speech and writing, for example, has elicited skepticism from many, even those <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2018/11/2/18053418/elon-musk-artificial-intelligence-google-deepmind-openai\">traditionally partial to technological advancement</a>.&nbsp; In this respect, the majority of criticism aimed at AI seems to stem from a place of concern for human value and ability; that is to say, AI poses a threat to capacities long-considered exclusive to people.&nbsp; In late November 2022, OpenAI, a non-profit research lab based in San Francisco, released ChatGPT to the public, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/\">garnering 100 million active users in just two months</a>.&nbsp; ChatGPT, short for “Conversational Generative Pretrained Transformer,” is a language-based AI model that’s trained on a diverse collection of books, articles, websites and databases, allowing it to generate unique, on-the-spot responses to any number of subjects.&nbsp; From its ability to write university-level papers, generate code and compose poetry, ChatGPT has taken the world by storm, setting a high bar for what a consumer AI model is and ought to be capable of.&nbsp; Naturally, the meteoric success of OpenAI’s model has prompted something of a technological race, with Google and other companies poised to release their own <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/06/technology/google-bard-ai-chatbot.html#:~:text=Google%20said%20on%20Monday%20that,at%20the%20end%20of%20November.\">consumer AI models to the public in the coming months</a>. Considering the degree of interest, financial and otherwise, that has been expressed in the development of new AI models and improvement of existing ones, people should read the room and come to the logical conclusion that AI is here to stay, and in light of this reality, we ought to learn to live with the changes it will doubtless bring to our lives.&nbsp; To begin, it’s difficult to stomach the reality that skills such as writing, poetry and storytelling, long considered to be pillars of human expression, may no longer be unique to people.&nbsp; For so long, artistic expression was regarded as among the most significant distinguishing factors between people and machines; now that that line has evidently been blurred, identifying the capacities truly singular to people has become a more challenging endeavor, but one that perhaps stands as humankind’s greatest obligation in light of the forthcoming circumstances.&nbsp; Educators, lawmakers and the general public should put less effort into lobbying for the restriction of AI due to its perceived threats to traditionally human roles, but rather invest more energy into fostering fundamentally irreplaceable skills like interpersonal communication, discernment and creativity, to name a few.&nbsp; What’s been observed over the past few months is just the tip of the iceberg in the greater narrative of AI that will play out in the coming decades. As a field defined by constant progress and innovation, whatever laws or regulations passed today with respect to the limits of artificial intelligence will likely be rendered obsolete within mere years of their passing.&nbsp; Thus, we ought to pay less mind to restricting the reach and capacities of artificial intelligence–such efforts would needlessly inhibit progress, but rather invest in the development of human capital and the capacities that truly distinguish us from machines.&nbsp;",

    "content": "Henry Gamble, News Editor— If one were to look at Denison’s campus twenty years ago, it would be almost unrecognizable. There would be no Eisner Center, no Hoaglin Wellness Center, no Knowlton Center and no turf field. Through large additions and structural rests, Denison has revolutionized itself as an institution. With a booming endowment and an increasingly large number of applicants, it seems that decades of growth are paying off. Denison is now the school of “And.” An institution that can offer students the widest range of amenities, activities and involvements possible at a university. A student at Denison can swim for one of the best division three teams and write for a satirical paper and study abroad and lead yoga classes at the same time. This is the future of the liberal arts education, and Denison leads the way by a great distance. Yet, sometimes it’s important to look ahead to plot a trajectory and see where this path will take Denison. It’s very possible that in several decades Denison will be one of the most prominent liberal arts institutions in the nation and a regional power in athletics. In addition, the creation of new subsidiaries will lead to an even greater physical diversification of the campus as a space. However, with a persistent focus on growth and expansion, it is possible that Denison might lose its way. At a certain point, it’s necessary for an institution to renovate and re-invigorate its existing facilities and programs. While this may seem “boring” or not as outwardly attractive, the academic core of a university is the great constant. Denison has systematically ignored its humanities programs, while at the same time greatly improving its competency in the Arts and Stem. Buildings such as Blair Knapp, Higley, Fellows and Barney-Davis Hall all are in serious need of renovation. With classrooms that struggle to host even minor technological adaptations, the university is falling be- hind its own standard. This is no way to say that Denison doesn’t attract the top tier of educators, it does. But, at a certain point, acclaimed professors will begin to leave because the campus lacks the bare minimum in terms of resources and spaces. While many, especially in Denison’s administration, will attribute this deficit to a cycle of renovation and construction, it is becoming clear to many that the school is not in the process of prioritizing its academics. Every semester, a new construction can be observed on campus, a multi-million dollar wellness center, or a new athletic facility, yet when is the last time that a projector in Blair Knapp Hall turned on with ease? Denison needs to be the school of “And then:” academics and then the rest. To be a pioneer in education, an institution must focus on education itself.&nbsp;",

    "content": "Mike Maynard, Staff Writer— As the spring semester has begun, so has the slow rise in Covid cases on campus. There has been chatter around campus recently about accessing tests at the Hoaglin Wellness Center. Initially, when cases began to increase, tests were easily able to be picked up in the lobby of the wellness center. Shortly after, tests were moved to behind the front desk, where students would then have to go up and request a test. Once this began, many students claimed to have been denied tests because they were not symptomatic. This has caused concern because many students are living with roommates who have tested positive and are now exposed to Covid. Student Ellie Laird ‘23 has been experiencing this very issue. As recent as Friday, February 10, 2023. Laird and two of her four roommates tested positive for ovid. A fourth roommate wanted to get a test but was denied. “They told me we didn’t need to test and that my 4th roommate didn’t need to test because everyone is a close contact and unless she was experiencing symptoms, they didn’t want to give her a test,” Laird said. According to Michelle Barcelona, a Nurse Practitioner and Associate Director of Medical Services at Hoaglin Wellness Center, students had been taking multiple tests at a time when Hoaglin preferred that students only test when they needed to. “We did move them behind [the front desk] because we needed to monitor the distribution of them more,” Barcelona said.&nbsp; Initially, there were instances of students testing shortly after their first test when typically there should be another test about five days in. Cases where tests are usually given are when students are exposed, typically by their roommate, and they are on day five, would be able to access a test. Hoaglin sent out an informational email on Wednesday,&nbsp; February 8, detailing how students can get vaccines, tests and guidelines for students who test positive.&nbsp; “As part of our care for our community, we expect students who are experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19 to test. Students who test positive for COVID-19 are required to isolate for a minimum of five days until they are a) asymptomatic or symptoms are resolving and b) they have been fever-free for 24 hours without medication,” the email said. That email also included that students must email <a href=\"mailto:wellness@denisnon.edu\">wellness@denisnon.edu</a> when they have tested positive.&nbsp; “Unfortunately, Covid is just not going to go away; I don’t think we’ll ever be without Covid,” Barcelona said.&nbsp; Barcelona emphasized the importance of masking up and practicing strategies to avoid exposure during peak periods like the beginning of the semester.",

    "content": "Torria Catrone, Editor-in-Chief— As the semester gets started, some departments on campus have yet to find their footing. Notably, Denison’s Student Mailroom has recently hit a few stumbling blocks.&nbsp; Students across campus are complaining about missing packages, an onslaught of (often incorrect) emails from the mailroom, and slow turnover between package delivery and pickup. What exactly is going on, and how can the campus community expect mailroom employees to respond to these concerns? “Last year… [there were] approximately 85,000 incoming packages just for Slayter,” said the mailroom’s supervisor, Amy Hannahs. This figure does not include mail or alumni packages, “as they aren’t recorded in the system,” she continued. There are currently 30 students on staff at the mailroom, all tasked with dealing with this high volume of deliveries. Throughout the day, they experience lots of turnover. It can be difficult to keep everything straight, especially from closing to opening the next day. “There’s inconsistencies from shift to shift,” says student Lily Anderson ‘24.&nbsp;&nbsp; There’s lots of factors working against them, Anderson explains. The mailroom’s layout is conducive to receiving snail mail, but lacks the floorspace needed to accommodate the high volume of packages they’re experiencing today. There’s more wall space than floor space behind that counter, and this can make it very difficult to keep things properly organized. On top of being student workers, mailroom employees fall under the umbrella of federal positions. They could face legal ramifications if they fail to observe confidentiality laws. In short, these students juggle a lot while trying to satisfy Denison’s wealth of online shoppers.&nbsp; As far as the emails go, there isn’t much student workers can do about it. The messaging system which the mailroom uses is called Pitney Bowes SendSuite Tracking, and is managed by their supervisor, Hannahs. The system is automated, and sends an email to the recipient when their package is scanned in by the mailroom. Since the implementation of this software, the amount of time between package delivery and pickup by the recipient has decreased greatly. This turnover is helpful to streamlining the mailroom’s process, but only if the email system is operating correctly. As of this past week, the excessive emails and incorrect notifications were said to have been fixed. Yet, some students are still reporting that the emails haven’t stopped.&nbsp; Anderson said that even though the mailroom just cut Sunday hours, Slayter Mailroom is open far more than you’ll find at other schools of Denison’s size. “Denison students consume a lot,” she said. The 30 mailroom workers are doing their best to keep up with all of that demand. They hold staff meetings once a month to check in with one another and standardize procedures. Even with these measures, it’s hard to coordinate. “There are so many moving parts to it,” said Anderson.&nbsp; As they head into the new year, the mailroom is planning to focus more on their social media presence and communication with the greater campus community. They are aware of the issues students are experiencing with their mail, and are working hard to fix it.&nbsp; Applications for the mailroom just closed this past Monday, February 13. Anderson hopes that their energy will help the mailroom keep up with the at-times overwhelming demand for mail on campus. If you have missing packages or mail, make sure to bring it up with the workers at the desk. Any one of the student managers will be happy to fill out a ‘Lost Packages Form’ with you and do their best to address your concern.",

    "content": "Julia Barker, Special to The Denisonian —- Gordon Parks (1912-2006) was an artist who dedicated his life to documenting social justice and issues of inequality within the American experience through photography, film and literature. From mid-January through March 29th the exhibition “Gordon Parks &amp; Contemporaries: Through the Lens” will be shown in the Denison Museum. This exhibition focuses on three photographers who have made their mark on photojournalism through the documentation of human existence. The work on exhibit highlights the work of not only Gordon Parks but his contemporaries Adger Cowans and Eli Reed. &nbsp;Parks is the first Black photographer to work for LIFE magazine documenting racial segregation and inequality in America. He’s been committed to showing social justice issues by focusing on the American experience through photography. Parks’ photographic work spans from the early 1940s to the 2000s, focusing on race relations, poverty, civil rights and urban life. Parks had a unique talent for capturing vivid emotion within the human experience through his work in photography, and his photos express the raw emotion that Americans felt in the face of segregation and countless other human rights issues.&nbsp; “Gordon Parks is a seminal Black photographer… and most people know him through his photojournalistic works.” said Megan Hancock, Senior Curator of Education and Exhibitions at the Denison Museum. “He worked for both the US government, through the Farm Security Administration (FSA) and war office… there are thousands of images, and… stories about what life in America was like at that time…”&nbsp; Parks also wrote poetry, novels and plays, composed music, and wrote and directed films. He’s recognized as the first Black American to have written, directed, and scored a major Hollywood motion picture. “Although most of us know his photography work, I think most people don’t realize he also wrote. He was writing a lot of the stories in LIFE, besides taking the photographs…We have the LIFE magazines on view, so you can look at and flip through the magazines…” said Hancock.&nbsp; The two artists featured alongside Gordon Parks are Eli Reed and Adger Cowans and they’ve both won the Gordon Parks Award. This is an award presented by The Gordon Parks Foundation to artists who reflect Parks’ ideas and goals by using creative methods to inspire further generations. “Out of a lot of these award winners, the two that were selected… helped expand the narrative of what we were trying to capture,” said Hancock. “Adger Cowans… is most well known for his work out on Hollywood sets…but he was also at a lot of different events… He was at the Malcolm X speech… He’s at the Newport Jazz Festival…Eli Reed is most well known for his photojournalistic work in Latin America, as well as the Middle East. He’s done stuff for National Geographic… but he has also worked out in Hollywood on music sets, and film sets…He was there during the protest and bombing of Beirut, he was there documenting the story of the Lost Boys when it was happening in the 90s.” Parks, Reed and Cowans use the power of photojournalism as a way to expand the narrative surrounding social justice issues, using their medium as a way to reveal human emotion through a photo. This exhibition is linked to the upcoming Vail concert featuring six-time Grammy® winner and Emmy® nominated trumpeter Terence Blanchard, the E-Collective, fellow Grammy® winners Turtle Island Quartet, and visual artist Andrew F. Scott, who will celebrate Gordon Parks’ work in a stunning multimedia concert of music and art.",

    "content": "Torria Catrone, Editor-in-Chief — As part of the ongoing Laura C. Harris and Beck lecture Series, Denison University welcomed Joy Harjo to campus for a third time. The three-term U.S. Poet Laureate visited campus twice before, once in 1991 and again in 2009. She returned this past week as part of programming entitled “An Evening with Joy Harjo: Women’s Empowerment, Indigenous Poetry, and Native Literature.”&nbsp; Harjo was the first native American to be appointed U.S. Poet Laureate in 2019, and served three terms in this position.&nbsp; During her tenure, Harjo collaborated with other Native poets to create the “Living Nations, Living Words” project. Featured on the Library of Congress’ website, it is an interactive map where viewers can listen to and read along with 47 different Native American poets. To begin the evening in Sharon Martin Hall, Harjo filled the space with the sounds of a wooden flute. In a sort of meditative practice, she improvised for a few minutes with her eyes closed. She then transitioned into an hour of readings from her own works and others. She spoke at length about her many published books, and shared with the audience about upcoming projects.&nbsp; Harjo’s most recently published book, <em>Weaving Sundown in a Scarlet Light, </em>is an experimental poetic memoir. This joins the ranks of her nearly 20 published works. After reading a couple of pieces from the book, Harjo shared: “I didn’t start out to reinvent memoir. I just wrote it how I thought it should be.” For the final hour of the program, she participated in a Q&amp;A with Denison faculty members David Baker and Linda Krumholz. They traded personal questions as well as questions from Professor Baker’s students. Harjo shared more insight on her creative process, upcoming projects, and reflected on her own poetry.&nbsp;",

The bee hotels were created<br>as a habitat for native bees to lay their eggs, which encourages the rebuilding of the bee<br>population.<br>The hotels were built by the studio art students in a mixed media and sculpture class with<br>Dr. Micaela Vivero and monitored by biology students under the supervision of Dr. Andrew<br>McCall. The art class produces about 18 hotels each semester.<br>Vivero has been teaching Studio Art at Denison for 18 years, focusing primarily on<br>sculpture and installation art. She said that “the native bees usually find places to nest in lawns or trees, but they can’t really do that on this campus, so the bee hotels provide more chances for<br>them to inhabit that space.”<br>Vivero said that another benefit of the hotels as art is that they “encourage students and<br>those coming to campus to ask what these things are, and then they get to learn about the native<br>bees.”<br>The hotels are made of untreated wood and special straws to provide nesting space. The<br>students found that straws nearly the same diameter as the bees seem to be preferable, as well as<br>soft edges around the entrance. These strategies are beneficial, for example, for leafcutter bees,<br>one of Ohio’s native species. Many people think of the honeybee when discussing pollinators,<br>although the honeybee isn’t a native species, having been brought here by European colonizers..<br>McCall has been teaching biology at Denison for 17 years with a focus on plant biology<br>and evolution. He said that he became interested in bees because people can’t think about plants<br>without thinking about their pollinators, which typically are bees.<br>“I spent a lot of time just following bees around to see which flowers they prefer, and<br>during that time, I came to the realization that many of these bees seemed to have personalities,”<br>McCall said.<br>The idea for the collaboration with art and science classes was sparked by Vivero, who<br>later applied for a grant to help bring the ideas together.<br>“The project that they make has to be outside in nature for years, so it has to be really<br>sturdy,” Vivero said. “The hotels could probably be made in an hour-long workshop, but the<br>ones we have created have been more complex.” In nature, leafcutter bees will cut off pieces of leaves to line the chambers of twigs to<br>house their young. The straws seen in a lot of the hotels are made to mimic the twigs so that bees<br>will use them to lay and hatch their eggs.<br>“My class would look to see if the straws had been inhabited, as well as if the physical<br>structure of the hotel was attracting bees or other organisms,” McCall said. “If you’re going to<br>make a free apartment, you can’t decide who’s going to come in, so sometimes ants will raid the<br>bee cabins … and parasitic wasps also pose a big issue.”<br>When the hotels begin to fall apart, they are moved out of circulation and replaced with<br>hotels from the latest class.<br>“I think it helped my students think about how we can give nature a little bit of a push but<br>also do it in a creative way,” McCall said. “The students get to see how people with varied<br>interests can work on the same project.”<br>Jade Rasmussen, a senior majoring in creative writing and minoring in studio art, took the<br>mixed media sculpture class in the fall of her first year at Denison.<br>“The class really showed Dr. Vivero’s talent as a professor, and her teaching was so<br>animated,” Rasmussen said. “I felt really inspired and encouraged as an artist, even when trying<br>something I’d never done before.”<br>McCall said that’s one of the goals.<br>“Art is very much like science in the sense that you’re always exploring. … The artists<br>that I’ve known are always thinking about pushing ahead and trying experimental things,” he<br>said.",

    "content": "Listed as a legal movie theater, the Denison Film Society has offered free weekly screenings to students, faculty, and the community for almost 50 years. But, most people don’t know about it. Cinema majors Kat Colvin ‘23 and Maya Barlow ‘23 are co-presidents of the club this year and want to make cinema more accessible. Screenings typically attract five to ten viewers, making it a very intimate environment. Most films are shown in the Slayter Auditorium, but they occasionally set up more informal screenings. “We call those our underground screenings,” Colvin said. DFS is required to buy the rights for all films shown, and it can get expensive. For example, for $725 they will have access to the film “Triangle of Sadness” after it leaves theaters. Anyone can be a DFS member by simply showing up to screenings, but the paid position of a projectionist allows for more involvement. “We try to gauge if people have a personal interest in film,” Barlow said. “It doesn’t have to be that they’re a cinema major and have an encyclopedia of film knowledge in their head, it’s just people that are passionate and reliable and want to make fun events for other people on campus.” With about 10 projectionists on the payroll suggesting films, Colvin and Barlow put together a schedule for screenings every weekend.&nbsp; Most features are based around holidays, heritage months, collaborations, or other events on campus. DFS caters to different interests with films ranging from the indie film “Smoke Signals” to popular blockbusters and “Barbie as Rapunzel.” The most recent screening, “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” was co-sponsored by the Departments of History, Black Studies, and Latin American &amp; Caribbean Studies. Professors also hosted a discussion panel afterwards. “We try to do a few talk-back films each semester where there’s a film on a specific relevant social issue, and afterwards we’ll host a discussion,” Barlow said. “There’s so much that can be communicated through film and it’s a really powerful teaching medium, so it’s really nice that departments are thinking of us.” Colvin and Barlow have worked to provide more opportunities for discourse, and to diversify film selections. In an attempt to make the environment more approachable and inclusive, there has been a great increase in female directors, black directors, and showings of international and foreign language films. Cinema is a typically male-dominated industry and is often seen as pretentious. There was a time when DFS projectionists were all men, but over the years the club has become more diverse. “We’re just trying to make this as approachable as possible and so we’re not interested in the ‘film canon’ and showing French films from the 1960’s,” Colvin said. “I know that’s a huge thing that people want to be pretentious about. Not knocking that, but how are you legitimately going to reach as many people as possible with films like that that are mostly just ostracizing newcomers and making them feel like they don’t know anything?” Some upcoming films this semester include Wes Anderson, Studio Ghibli, and horror film double features, along with a variety of other recognizable movies. In the future they hope to have more student body picks and informal events. “We want to have the community’s interests in mind and operate to bridge the gap between “cinema” in its formal term versus getting together watching a movie. It’s one of the easiest social things ever, and it’s fun,” Barlow said.",

    "content": "Charlie Thompson, Staff Writer— Denison’s Club Ice Hockey team has recently found itself rising quickly through the ranks of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA). In a dire series against regional division rival University of Richmond, Big Red Ice Hockey showed out, displaying their dominance and sweeping the Spiders in two lopsided games, 9-3 in game one and 6-0 in game two. Needing these wins to secure a spot in the Atlantic Coast Conference Hockey League (ACCHL) playoffs, the Big Red rose to the occasion, and punched their ticket to the postseason tournament.&nbsp; Despite Richmond’s home rink advantage, the first game was only evenly matched for the first period. The Spiders’ starting goalie Will Hopewell was hopeless between the pipes, as in the first period alone he allowed two goals in under ten minutes of play. Just over two and a half minutes into the game, Big Red defenseman Charlie Whalen ‘26 slipped the puck into the back of the net, followed by a goal from Noah DiFilippo ‘24, assisted by John Yavari ‘25. Richmond fired back late with two power play goals, tying the game shortly before first intermission, but as the puck dropped at the start of the second period, the Spiders lost control. Denison’s Ethan Wippf ‘25 and Yavari, who was assisted by Seth Kaplan ‘26 were both able to skate through the weak Richmond defense to score in the second, while Preston Fisk ‘25, with Kaplan assisting again, scored on a powerplay just before the end of the half. The overwhelming nature of the Big Red offense became apparent in the second, as the Spiders tallied a total of ten minutes of penalties due to their poor play.&nbsp; To seal game one, Denison’s offense scored four more times in the third period, closing out the game with a six-goal lead on the Spiders. DiFilippo scored once more, while Justin Rink ‘23, Kaplan, and Duncan Humphries ‘25 all notched goals of their own, assisted by Wippf, Nick Podesta ‘24, Yavari, and Nick Salerno ‘25, respectively. Game two was even more lopsided for the Big Red, as they shut out the Spiders with a commanding performance from goalie Brennan Holmes ‘25. Lukas Cheris ‘26, assisted by Rink, drew first blood in the first period, leading to a scoring frenzy in the second. Fisk, assisted by Thomas Kreske ‘26 and Kaplan, was able to score twice on the flailing Richmond goalie, while DiFilippo scored his third goal of the series just before the period ended.&nbsp; The game was wrapped up with goals by Wippf and Humphries, but not before a little fun was had. Holmes, who stayed in goal for most of the game, received a delay of game penalty, and to decide who was going to head to the penalty box, the referees decided to have Denison’s players do ‘nose-goes’, with Whalen being the last to do so. It was a fun way to end the series, with Denison improving to 14-7 on the season, as well as qualifying for the ACCHL playoffs at the end of this month. “It was a good two wins coming back from break; we played well as a team, had a lot of shots on net, and we’re looking forward to the playoffs in Winston-Salem,” Kaplan said.&nbsp; More recently, Denison beat the University of Dayton in a two-game series on Feb. 3-4, winning 4-1 in game one, and winning game two in a shootout 5-4. They will head down to Winston-Salem, NC for their first ACCHL playoff game on Feb. 17.",

    "content": "Patrick Fitzgerald, Special to <em>The Denisonian</em>— The Denison Men’s Basketball team clashed with Hiram in Granville on Wednesday, Feb. 1. The Big Red entered this game with a four-game winning streak against the Terriers dating back to the 2019-2020 season. The streak continued as they won 78-58 behind Darren Rubin ’24’s 17 points in 21 minutes of action. The large margin of victory was in contrast to their earlier season meeting on Jan. 14, in which the Big Red narrowly prevailed 80-76 in overtime.&nbsp; The standout guard commented on the difference between the two games. “Last time we got up early 18-3, and I think we just let our foot off the gas. That’s kind of been one of our issues this entire year, so tonight we really focused on not letting that happen,” Rubin said. This time, the team never trailed, only being tied for 1:50 and leading for the rest.&nbsp; The game was very close through the first ten minutes, Denison leading 21-18 at the ten-minute mark of the first half. The Big Red never looked back, going on a 7-0 run shortly after. They entered halftime with a 43-33 lead, capped off by a Will Hunter ‘23 behind-the-head pass to Ricky Radtke ‘25.&nbsp; The second half was much of the same. Denison started the second half with a 16-6 run and the game was all but over from there. Through the first ten minutes of the first half, Hiram guard Brodgie Gordon scored ten points on perfect shooting. Gordon ended the game with only 14 points despite the hot start, being shut down by Scotty Dean ‘25. The big win was thanks to their defense. They grabbed 12 steals to Hiram’s six, which led to 19 points off turnovers. Denison also had a huge advantage in free throws, shooting ten more than the Terriers. Nick Heath ‘26 led an impressive bench effort, scoring 14 of the team’s 34 bench points. In totality, the Big Red controlled the pace of the game and sped up Hiram’s offense due to the pressure applied by the guards. Top performers included Rubin with 17 points, who went a perfect 7-7 from the charity stripe. Radtke recorded a dominating 13 rebounds and 11 points on great efficiency. Scotty Dean was a nightmare for Hiram tallying a staggering seven steals. Dean was extremely active on both ends and was a huge reason why Denison scored eight fast break points. Emmett Burnside ‘24 was very impactful in his 15 minutes of run, grabbing six points, seven rebounds, and a team-high four assists. With the win, the Big Red collected a crucial home victory against a conference opponent. As the NCAC tournament approaches, the team is trying to climb up the standings. They surely have their work cut out for them, though, as Rubin added. “Our next four games are against four of the top five teams in the league, so they are going to be tough ones. It would be awesome for us to host a tournament game. If we have a winning record through these, I think that’s a real possibility,” Rubin said.&nbsp; On Saturday, Feb. 4, the team took their first step toward achieving that goal by defeating DePauw 76-70 and improving their season record to 11-9. Their remaining schedule of entirely conference matchups continues with a Senior Day face-off against Wabash on Wednesday, Feb. 8.",

The viewing was accompanied by a Q&amp;A with Professor Isabelle Choquet of the French and Modern Languages Department.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Their Algeria</em> is a documentary-style film, which follows the lives of two Algerian immigrants in France, as they divorce after decades of marriage.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directed by their granddaughter, Lina Soualem, <em>Their Algeria</em> is an attempt to finally unpack years of loss and trauma endured by her grandparents through their initial journey to France and hardships once they had arrived.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Choquet explained that Soualem is forced to use her medium to facilitate these difficult conversations, as the presence of the camera allows her to create a more indirect line of communication with her oftentimes unforthcoming grandparents.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the sense of loss, Soualem additionally highlights the various coping mechanisms used by her grandparents to avoid touching on painful memories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout the film, her grandmother’s distinct laughter and her grandfather’s deep silence, cut with incomprehensible tangents, demonstrate the extent of the suppression.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choquet said that “she [Soualem] uses several strategies to overcome this silence several times, first she shows pictures, and then different recordings from the past, it’s not until she begins to ask and show pictures of her great-grandparents, that the silence begins to break.” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the very end of the film, her grandfather can be finally seen smiling and speaking to Soualem more openly, as she returns from a long journey home to the village where her grandparents had once lived in Algeria.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conversations being had in this film are very similar to those being had on a larger and international scale, explained Choquet. “Just recently, French President Emmanuel Macron made a diplomatic trip to Algiers, as conversations and acknowledgments about the brutal realities of French colonization and the Algerian War are becoming less taboo.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a broader context, the questions posed by Soualem about cultural loss and assimilation through immigration are never answered, yet they promote deep reflections in both Soualem and her family, who finally come face to face with their complicated and painful histories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Choquet used a quote from an interview with Soualem to capture the complexity of her heritage, “My grandparents spent sixty years of their life in France, but they’re not French, They couldn’t go back to Algeria but they feel Algerian.” If a new understanding would be pulled from the film, Choquet thinks that the complexity of identity is exemplified as a truly intricate puzzle, and certainly not as the binary issue it tends to be categorized as.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Middle Eastern Film Festival continues with the screening of <em>Our River, Our Sky </em>(2021), in Herrick Hall at 6 pm on Feb. 6th.&nbsp;",

    "content": "Julia Barker, Staff Writer— The Ukrainian practice of pysanka making is a tradition that dates back to the bronze age, used throughout decades as an object of worship and celebration. Ukrainian pysanka making is the traditional practice of egg decorating that uses wax resistance to create intricate patterns and designs, each having a different meaning and set of symbols. Martha Mudri, a member of the Ukrainian Cultural Association of Ohio (UCAO), visited Denison to talk about the history of pysanka making, as well as to demonstrate how a traditional pysanka is made.&nbsp; The word pysanka comes from word ‘pysaty,’ which means to write. In ancient times, Mudri states, “people made replicas of eggs out of clay, glass, and ceramics, and decorated them as if they were eggs, and that is something that archaeologists have been able to find and date.” The practice of pysanka-making dates back to pre-Christianity.&nbsp; Mudri says, “In 988, at the turn of the second century, Ukraine became a Christian nation, so prior to that, anyone in that area was Pagan.” During this time of religious divide, there were efforts made to stamp out this practice within Ukraine, but that only worked to an extent. People of non-nobility continued making pysankas, upholding the spiritual and Pagan practices associated with this tradition.&nbsp; Mudri says that “instead of this tradition being stopped, it was instead co-opted into the Christian motifs of Easter.” Christian tradition has adopted the traditional practice of pysanka making, evolving and Americanizing the practice of egg dying into what is more commonly known today as Easter eggs. The symbolism seen within traditional pysanka making can vary based on location within each region of Ukraine. Each region has different traditional pattern forms, design choices, and colors that vary depending on the history of that region and the important iconography present there.&nbsp; Common designs used within pysanka making include symbols of the sun, animal motifs, line designs, plants, flowers, and man-made agricultural symbols. Each symbol represents different beliefs within Pagan tradition and Ukrainian folklore, and these symbols often hold power within the Pagan community.&nbsp; Murdri continued, stating, “The Pagans in the area of the world that became Ukraine held the egg in high esteem. It was a dual symbol of both life and birth.” Pagans of this time connected the power of the egg to their worship of the sun, believing that both were sources of life. Murdi said both were, “Life-giving, and life’s sustaining” within Pagan tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the history of Pagan rituals and pysanka making, the pysanka became a tool of worship for Ukrainian Pagans of the time. Murdi states that pysankas became, “a talisman that can ward off bad luck, or bring good luck.”&nbsp; Within Pagan tradition, the egg is known to hold the same power as the sun based on the season, having the most in springtime as the sun began to reemerge from the winter. Through this historical development and changes within religious affiliation, pysankas became a token within Ukrainian history and culture, and the symbols present within the different designs show different aspects of Ukrainian traditions. The practice of pysanka making is a tradition that dates back to before written history. The importance of pysankas within Ukrainian culture is passed down generationally through families and communities through Ukrainian folklore, history, and culture. Through the antiquity of Pagan religious practice and pysanka making, the pysanka became a symbol of worship for the Ukrainian people. Pysanka making today still holds an incredibly significant role in Ukrainian culture and is a symbol of Ukrainian history and cultural development.",

From there, you could get to Cincinnati or Cleveland in 2 hours in the comfort of a reclining seat on a train traveling up to 110 MPH. While it may be fantasy now, it could soon be a reality. Using money from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act passed by Congress in 2021, Amtrak is pursuing an expansion of the nation’s passenger rail network, and Ohio will need to decide by March 20th if it’s on board or not. Although a number of routes have been proposed for Ohio under the program, the most eye-catching is the 3C+D route between Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton, and Cincinnati; a route which hasn’t been served by passenger trains since 1967. Currently, passenger rail service in Ohio is limited to two lines which only come to the state in the middle of the night. Governor DeWine has indicated a <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2023/01/is-ohio-finally-on-board-for-amtrak-expansion-state-strongly-considering-seeking-federal-money-for-new-train-service.html\">tepid willingness</a> to pursue passenger rail expansion in Ohio, but has yet to commit to it. I believe the state should embrace the opportunity wholeheartedly. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/upshot/transportation-emerges-as-crucial-to-escaping-poverty.html\">Studies have found</a> that commute time is the primary indicator as to whether or not a person can escape poverty. 10% of households in Columbus, 21% in Dayton, 22% in Cincinnati, and more than 25% in Cleveland <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/2017/01/vehicles_per_household_for_eac.html\">don’t own a car</a> and have been left behind by infrastructure. Connecting our cities by rail would give new freedom and opportunity to these families. After decades of disinvestment in Ohio’s cities, Amtrak service could rejuvenate our urban areas. Gen Z has a lower driver’s license attainment rate and owns fewer cars <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2021/08/04/kids-and-cars-todays-teens-in-no-rush-to-start-driving/48148523/\">than any other generation</a>. Making alternative modes of travel available in Ohio could attract young people to our graying state, and make it a more attractive place to do business. Amtrak would also be a boon for our environment. Passenger rail emits <a href=\"https://www.amtrak.com/travel-green\">up to 83% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than driving and up to 73% fewer emissions than flying</a>. If we want Ohio to be serious about combating climate change, Amtrak expansion is an obvious solution. Ohio shouldn’t allow itself to be left behind. Our fellow Midwestern states have already reaped the benefits of Amtrak service. Pennsylvania and Illinois both have fast, reliable, and frequent trains which connect their major cities, including to other states. Even in Michigan, travelers in Detroit can catch a train to Chicago at 110 MPH. Since when have Ohioans accepted second place to Michigan? Opponents of passenger rail often deride it as a waste of time and money, but this is false. While the 3C+D line would cost $100 million to construct, it would generate <a href=\"https://www.daytondailynews.com/local/ohio-examining-feasibility-of-passenger-rail-expansion-with-amtrak/PGBKBHKOJJC3TLDHRMJW4CFX4M/\">$130 million in economic benefits for Ohio</a>. If $100 million gives you sticker shock, consider that <a href=\"https://www.transportation.ohio.gov/projects/mega-projects/mega-projects/75-valley\">$30 million more is being spent to add a single lane of traffic to a 1.8-mile stretch of I-75</a> this year.&nbsp; It is likely that Amtrak itself would cover a large portion of the cost, but this and many other questions can’t be answered unless the state takes steps to engage them. Of course this would all take time, but as the saying goes, “the second best time to plant a tree is now”. Given the benefits, it would be foolish to not pursue this opportunity, but ultimately this is about choice. While driving is good for many purposes, it shouldn’t be forced on every person for every purpose. Ohioans deserve to be provided choices for how they wish to travel, whether it be by car, or hopefully someday by rail.",

    "content": "Julia Barker, Special to <em>The Denisonian</em>– The Ukrainian practice of pysanka making is a tradition that dates back to the bronze age, used throughout decades as an object of worship and celebration. Ukrainian pysanka making is the traditional practice of egg decorating that uses wax resistance to create intricate patterns and designs, each having a different meaning and set of symbols. Martha Mudri, a member of the Ukrainian Cultural Association of Ohio (UCAO), visited Denison to talk about the history of pysanka making, as well as to demonstrate how a traditional pysanka is made.&nbsp; The word pysanka comes from word ‘pysaty’, which means to write. In ancient times, Mudri states, “people made replicas of eggs out of clay, glass, and ceramics, and decorated them as if they were eggs, and that is something that archaeologists have been able to find and date.” The practice of pysanka-making dates back to pre-Christianity.&nbsp; Mudri says, “In 988, at the turn of the second century, Ukraine became a Christian nation, so prior to that, anyone in that area was Pagan.” During this time of religious divide, there were efforts made to stamp out this practice within Ukraine, but that only worked to an extent. People of non-nobility continued making pysankas, upholding the spiritual and Pagan practices associated with this tradition.&nbsp; Mudri says that “instead of this tradition being stopped, it was instead co-opted into the Christian motifs of Easter.” Christian tradition has adopted the traditional practice of pysanka making, evolving and Americanizing the practice of egg dying into what is more commonly known today as Easter eggs. The symbolism seen within traditional pysanka making can vary based on location within each region of Ukraine. Each region has different traditional pattern forms, design choices, and colors that vary depending on the history of that region and the important iconography present there.&nbsp; Common designs used within pysanka making include symbols of the sun, animal motifs, line designs, plants, flowers, and man-made agricultural symbols. Each symbol represents different beliefs within Pagan tradition and Ukrainian folklore, and these symbols often hold power within the Pagan community.&nbsp; Murdri continued, stating, “The Pagans in the area of the world that became Ukraine held the egg in high esteem. It was a dual symbol of both life and birth.” Pagans of this time connected the power of the egg to their worship of the sun, believing that both were sources of life. Murdi said both were, “Life-giving, and life’s sustaining” within Pagan tradition.&nbsp;&nbsp; Through the history of Pagan rituals and pysanka making, the pysanka became a tool of worship for Ukrainian Pagans of the time. Murdi states that pysankas became, “a talisman that can ward off bad luck, or bring good luck.”&nbsp; Within Pagan tradition, the egg is known to hold the same power as the sun based on the season, having the most in springtime as the sun began to reemerge from the winter. Through this historical development and changes within religious affiliation, pysankas became a token within Ukrainian history and culture, and the symbols present within the different designs show different aspects of Ukrainian traditions. The practice of pysanka making is a tradition that dates back to before written history. The importance of pysankas within Ukrainian culture is passed down generationally through families and communities through Ukrainian folklore, history, and culture. Through the antiquity of Pagan religious practice and pysanka making, the pysanka became a symbol of worship for the Ukrainian people. Pysanka making today still holds an incredibly significant role in Ukrainian culture and is a symbol of Ukrainian history and cultural development.",

    "content": "Every year the Burpees welcome a new crop of eager improv comedians who are ready to go “out on a limb” and this year is no different. For those who don’t know, founded in 1979, the Burpees (officially known as the Burpees Seedy Theatrical Company) is the oldest collegiate improv group in the country. Their rich legacy on the hill is indisputable and includes one of&nbsp; Denison’s most famous alumni, Steve Carell ‘84, who was part of the group in it’s early days.&nbsp; The Burpees held their annual auditions last Saturday, February 4th. Several students were called back the next day for a second round of auditions before final decisions were made about new members. It was a weekend full of improv games and performances meant to determine how prospective Burpees would fit into the close-knit group.&nbsp; And the Burpees take their auditions seriously, because they’ve formed such a strong bond that’s allowed them to feel comfortable in vulnerable situations.&nbsp; “Getting up there can be really intimidating and so it’s really important that when you’re on stage to be able to trust the people you’re with, and a big part of that is being friends and being close and having a good group dynamic,” said member Sam Wyckoff ‘23.&nbsp; One of the most important aspects of the Burpees is being a team player. At auditions, they were looking for people who would be able to click with the rest of the group, as well as people who were open-minded and ready to learn. The new sophomore and freshman students that will be joining the Burpees won’t necessarily have to have a background in performing as long as they are ready to step out of their comfort zone.&nbsp; “It happens, people come in with experience, but experience is definitely not a qualifier,” said Wyckoff.&nbsp; They obviously want to make the crowd laugh and make sure everyone is enjoying themselves but the Burpees consider their show a success as long as they’ve had a good time as a group. “If you and your scene partner had a lot of fun that’s just as good as the whole crowd laughing,” said Wyckoff.&nbsp; One of their biggest goals for this year is to reach out and connect with the broader community more through their performances. Last semester, they performed at the Granville Arts Fair and ReMix, as well as at their Big Red Weekend and Halloween shows. They also teach improv classes to local schools, including Granville Middle School. But their biggest performance by far is their annual 24 hour show, a show that Phoebe Martin ‘24 described as a “really fun hurdle.”&nbsp; While the show may be a logistical challenge for the group, they are also thankful for the opportunity to raise money for charity. One of their proudest accomplishments was raising $2,000 for the Incarcerated Nations Network a few years ago.&nbsp; “I felt like we were doing something,” said Martin.&nbsp; And improv has helped the Burpees gain important skills outside of performing. They’ve not only learned how to work closely with each other, but how to be confident in their own skin and make quick decisions.&nbsp; “I think what’s cool is that all the skills we’ve learned here are applicable for life and push us out of our comfort zones,” said member Tait Ferguson ‘23.&nbsp; In the past few years, it’s seemed like the Burpees are comprised of mostly women, but the group’s demographics have been much different in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp; “Historically the burpees have not been super inclusive,” said Ferguson.&nbsp; Members have heard sentiments from alumni that the group is funnier when led by male students, but new Burpees have pushed back against that rhetoric.&nbsp; “What we’re looking for is people that really connect with the group and that can happen with every gender,” said Wyckoff ‘23.&nbsp; “We’re not trying to get up and make a statement, we just want to collect funny people. And Sometimes that’s a lot of girls, sometimes that’s a lot of guys, sometimes it’s an even split,” echoed Martin.&nbsp; To the members of this group, the Burpees is about more than just performing comedy for their fellow Denisonians. It’s about long-lasting friendships, growing performance skills and building confidence that will serve them well post-Denison as they go “out on a limb.”",

    "content": "Emily Gryllakis, Special to <em>The Denisonian</em> Spend five minutes scrolling through social media or reading a popular magazine and there is a good chance you will see at least one article detailing new self-care practices to incorporate into your life. These practices are, of course, always accompanied by advertisements and are marketed as necessities to reach interpersonal fulfillment. Which of us isn’t intrigued by the idea of inner peace being a facemask away?&nbsp; The phrase ‘self-care’ conjures images of a spa day, pretty journals, or some good old-fashioned retail therapy. There is room for these things in an individual’s life, but conflating mental hygiene with consumer goods is disingenuous at best and dangerous at worst. Many of us are compelled by fantasy and blinded by the promise of a quick fix. This leads to normal people chasing a dragon and companies lining their pockets; not to mention the waste of cheap plastic products that will quickly be thrown out, if not collecting dust on someone’s shelf (clutter can actually worsen mental distress long term.)&nbsp; Estimated to be worth 20 Billion U.S.D. as of 2022, the wellness industry is a behemoth that has grown ever larger in the past ten years. Although self-improvement snake oil has been around forever, self-care started to look like how we know it today back in 2015-16. Bath bombs entered the cultural consciousness, companies like Glossier exploded onto the beauty scene, and wellness became synonymous with consumption. In 2020 when people were literally and figuratively stuck, they turned to the “Order Now” button. Esoteric wellness practices made their way into the mainstream as a balm for the worries and frustrations that characterized the year. It’s never a good thing to solely turn to consumption for comfort. It’s worse when physical health is neglected as a consequence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Physical health has a direct impact on mental state, but that dimension of self-care is often overlooked. Diet and exercise are underrepresented in wellness industry marketing because although they can and have been commodified, they needn’t necessarily be. A strong foundation is critical to maintaining quality of life with age. It’s much harder to monetize lightweight lifting and a healthy diet than it is to hawk a cure-all piece of plastic, so the wellness industry must resort to a dualistic ethos. The dichotomization of the brain and the body is an illusion that helps to keep us dutiful consumers.&nbsp; The individual consumer is not blameless. The business model that allows the wellness industry to thrive couldn’t work without the participation of individuals. We live in a time when instant gratification has never been easier, and never before have we been so constantly bombarded by advertising. The future is uncertain, so we are encouraged to “treat ourselves”. Undoubtedly this has affected the human psyche and eroded our ability to conceptualize long-term outcomes. Despite the exacerbating factors, each of us has free will and the capacity for critical thought. There is a comfort in the tangible and immediate but while a fancy new water bottle or pack of meditation prompt cards might bring temporary happiness, lifestyle has a far more significant role in health and wellness. A mini mini-fridge won’t cure your anxiety. It’s worth it to take time to think about the way we live: Are you taking care of yourself or a business’s bottom line?",

    "content": "AARON SKUBBY, Editor-in-Chief— A little over a year ago, Seyeong Hanlim ‘23 would have never considered herself an artist. But now, her solo exhibition titled “Afterimage” is leaving Denison’s Mulberry House to be displayed at galleries in Seoul, South Korea, and Chicago, Illinois. Afterimage is a feminist exhibition of 34 performance videos, paintings, and sculptures that are based on the experience of women workers in male dominated fields.&nbsp; Originally from Ansan, South Korea, Hanlim is combining her experiences at home and in the United States to illuminate the challenges faced by women workers. She explained that South Korea has a prominent antifeminist culture, which made it difficult to find galleries to host her work.&nbsp; With a political science major, and minors in philosophy and studio art, Hanlim fell in love with art late in her Denison career, first discovering her passion during a sculpting class her junior year. Suffering from burnout in regular academics, Hanlim was originally taking the sculpting class to fulfill general education requirements. But through the class, she found that art could be a medium to convey the social messages she is so passionate about in a form that goes beyond the pages of an essay. While on display at a gallery in Korea, one of Hanlim’s previous artworks was vandalized – the only piece of feminist artwork on display in that gallery. But the experience inspired Hanlim to create a new work called “Breakable Existence” in her current gallery, a piece which she invites audiences to destroy or repair during exhibitions. Before finding her calling as an artist, Hanlim has done a lot on Denison’s campus and in her life. She has published research, is an intern at the Consortium on Gender, Security, and Human rights, works several jobs, and much more.&nbsp; “I’m just a generally overcommitted person,” she said. “When I get really motivated and passionate about a topic, I really can’t stop myself and I just keep on pushing myself until I’m content and satisfied with my work. To say that Hanlim has an impressive intellectual track record would be an understatement. But it’s art that has brought Hanlim so much meaning in her final semesters at Denison. “Art gives me a kind of legitimacy and support that I need for myself. It’s really helpful for my mental health. I’ve grown to love myself through art,” Hanlim said. The work in her exhibitions are all based upon the experiences of dozens of women that Hanlim interviewed with support from the feminist non-profit organization Wise and Circle (WNC). There are sculptures, paintings, interactive pieces, and even a work created with participation from Denison students (including myself).&nbsp; Hanlim hopes to use her art as a medium for making political statements. She draws inspiration from artists like Ai Weiwei, Doris Salcedo, and Yayoi Kusama.&nbsp; The process of getting her work in galleries was not easy. While she has gotten several acceptances, Hanlim has a long spreadsheet of everywhere she has applied. She credits the help of professors Micaela Vivero, Chris Faur, and Shahid Khan for helping her accomplish what she has so far. Prior to becoming an artist, Hanlim was interested in being a lawyer. Her interest in art has not replaced that desire – rather, she hopes to work in human rights law in the future, and also display those important messages through her art, <em>While Afterimage is departing Denison’s campus, you can still see Hanlim’s art and messages on her website: seyeonghanlim.com</em>",

    "content": "Henry Gamble, News Editor— In 2021, the Anti-Defamation League recorded the highest amount of anti-semitic vandalism, harassment and assault since the organization began keeping track in 1979. Anti-semitism is no way a recent concoction. Jewish people have experienced discrimination for hundreds if not thousands of years. I believe that there is a common misconception when addressing anti-semitism. This form of discrimination is not necessarily religious in nature, but takes attributes of racism as well. A brief history of anti-semitic developments demonstrates as much.&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the 19th century and mass immigration to the United States, this racial conception was not widespread. It was only when large populations of Ashkenazi Jews, stemming from central and eastern Europe, arrived in the U.S. that targeted campaigns against Jewish peoples as a race began.&nbsp; European anti-semitism saw a similar rise in the late 19th century, culminating in the rise of Germany’s Nazi Party in the early 20th century. The Nazis categorized Jews by blood, and began accusing the Jewish people of Germany of racial, social, and economic conspiracies.&nbsp; These rumors were perpetuated across the world, especially in the United States where prominent figures such as Henry Ford perpetuated these dangerous lies.&nbsp; Alt-right parties in the U.S. have never stopped spreading conspiracies about Jewish peoples, yet they have often been dismissed as fringe. However important their influence had been in the past, these groups have garnered large followings on social media platforms such as 4Chan, and most recently Twitter.&nbsp; Since 2016, conspiracy theories have been touted more and more by political movements and figures. These conspiracies frequently associate Jewish peoples with mass manipulation or control of some sort.&nbsp; I retell these histories for a multitude of reasons: because they are so frequently forgotten, because anti-semitism is not some distant horror of the past, because the President of the United States had to personally remind the country that the Holocaust happened, because racists and antisemites such as Kanye West are given platforms to share their hate, and beacause silence and inaction continue to contribute to the problem.&nbsp; Considering the current circumstances, and as someone with deep personal and familial connections to Judaism, I am disappointed to read articles published by students of this campus that are at best irresponsible in their representation of antisemitism and at worst apologist. It is not time to lament about claims of suppression of criticism of the Israeli state, which are political in nature, which should and rightfully are separate from hate speech and anti-semitism It is not time to attempt to connect the rightful silencing of harmful anti-semitic narratives and the unjust silencing and censoring of Black and minority individuals. And it is certainly never time to make erroneous claims which allege unjust “limitation” against figures advancing antisemitic narratives such as Kyrie Irving. Events such as the 2021 insurrection at the U.S capitol demonstrate to what extent conspiracy theories may embolden fringe and radical groups, and the toleration or defense, of any form, of anti-semitism contributes to this very real and very dangerous situation we find ourselves a part of.",

    "content": "O. René Garrett Wright, Staff Writer— When is it not a precarious moment to be a queer person? When have we ever been invulnerable? To violence? To crisis? To precarity? The recent domestic terror attack at Club Q&nbsp; in Colorado Springs has left many bereft and without a moment for pause. While conversations about the shooter’s identity and the bravery of those who intervened continue, how do we respond, as organizations, institutions, and individuals, to this lack of safety and security?&nbsp; It is truly a precarious moment to be queer. The risk of COVID-19 has kept many queer people from dating, hooking up, or simply gathering in person, for some in the rural and midwestern U.S. intimacy of this variety is already a rarity without the threat of airborne contagion. As the pandemic continues, many have had to renegotiate social life and we have all made the adaptations where possible, and perhaps there are more to be made. However, for queer disabled people who are especially vulnerable to viral infection, these renegotiations of social and sexual intimacy might retrench already present barriers to social life.&nbsp; It was only April 2022 when the U.S. Center for Disease Control recommended queer men to get vaccinated against meningitis as Flordia public healthcare systems reckoned with one of the worst outbreaks of meningococcal disease among gay and bisexual men in U.S. history. There are differing types of vaccines according to meningitis subtype A, B, C – B apparently is wreaking havoc. But wait, monkeypox (MPX), the viral zoonosis related to but less severe than Smallpox, should also be on queer person’s inoculation schedule! And where do you go to get that taken care of? Especially if you are not particularly tapped into a queer network where this information circulates, you know – someone closeted.&nbsp; Publically we might reject this kind of vulnerability and do our best to connect people in our networks to resources in times of need. Yet, in public, it was only in 1977 when Norman Podhoretz, Columbia graduate and recipient of a Presidential Medal of Freedom from George Bush in 2004, authored a column holding queer people accountable for U.S. shortfalls in the Cold War. As Gayle Rubin says, “[explicitly] linking the domestic anti-gay fight to the anti-communist battles in foreign policy.” The U.S. domestic stage has been a home for anti-queer propaganda.&nbsp; We have always been in a precarious moment whether anti-queer violence has been supplied in part or in whole by medical, social, or political interactions and structures. Dr. Maia Kotrosits, in an article on vulnerability and penetration, sheds light on vulnerability writing: “What I want, what my experience pushes me to demand, is some new and perhaps warmer concepts that accommodate the pushes and pulls, the more minor and intriguing, and sometimes uncomfortable, impressions and touches that shape erotic life and relationships at large—and that do so without a sense of ontological shattering.” I would add to Kotrosits’ claim for anti-fragility that attention to difference, privilege, and power shape our sense of vulnerability and precarity.&nbsp; So we might say it’s a miracle at all that queer people are around, in many ways louder than ever, resisting pressure not to exist, to die, to fall ill, or through the cracks. Back in the United States, the Center for Disease Control released a report in 2016 claiming that without significant intervention, seroprevalence, the morbidity level of a blood-related disease, namely HIV/AIDS, among Black queer men could reach levels of 1 in 2 by 2050. However, in another report titled, “From COVID-19 to Monkeypox: Unlearned Lessons for Black, Latino, and Other Men With HIV Who Have Sex With Men” the claim is simple, we will only get better outcomes by vaccinating the most vulnerable, in this situation Black and brown folks. What we might learn about vulnerability from this meaningful approach is that in moments where structures produce insecurity or violent situations, queerness is not itself a flat one-way street of risk, depending on where you go the house are made of sticks.&nbsp;",

    "content": "Pol Le, New Editor— Denison has raised the student wage from $10.30 to $12.30 starting December 2022 as a reflection of the increase in cost-of-living expenses. This is also thanks to the advocacy of lifeguard students working at the Trumbull Aquatics Center.&nbsp; The head lifeguards took the initiative by emailing the administration for a raise in hourly pay due to the severely understaffed situation at the<strong> </strong>pool.&nbsp; “All the head guards contacted the administration, and we said that we needed to see changes,” Isabella Pereira ‘25 said. She is currently one of the head guards at Denison. According to protocol, there must be four people rotating every 15 minutes between three lifeguard chairs and the office.&nbsp; The head guard will stay in the office. They have to ensure participant safety through vigilant scanning and responding to all emergency situations as first responders during all hours of operation.&nbsp; However, because their department doesn’t have sufficient staffing, Pereira said that all the head guards and her faculty employer have to sit at the chairs for their full shift. With no rotations, it’s hard for students to keep their attention on the pool at all times. This would hinder them from responding quickly should an accident present itself. To Pereira, being a lifeguard is more demanding than many other jobs on campus.“We cannot do homework on the chair. We have to be CPR certified. You have to participate in monthly training, so if an emergency happens, we guide people doing what we gotta do,” she said.&nbsp; The increase in wages is good news for the majority of students, but it still fails to incentivise lifeguard applicants in the future. Pereira explained that the guards are looking forward to the tiered wage structure being implemented by the administration. They are aiming for hourly pay of lifeguards for 15-16 dollars and head guards for 17-18 dollars because that is the only incentive for people to work for the athletics department as a lifeguard.&nbsp; The tiered wage structure will be taken into consideration through student input by Nicole Saunier. For now, the new wage increase is a commitment of the Administration and the Student Life to ensure that students are fairly compensated.&nbsp; For many international students, this is a great relief to their financial plan.&nbsp; “I start working for more hours during December because of the wage increase, mainly to cover the cost of the upcoming winter break,” Draco Bui ‘26 said. “It’s quite frustrating that international students cannot stay at school during this holiday season, so I would need to pay for traveling, food, and rent during this time.” More than that, the wage increase gives students an incentive to find jobs on campus that benefit their career development in the future. These job experiences can be included in their CV, which gives them the advantage to find jobs after graduation. Hence, the annual increase in hourly pay is crucial to support student employees to cope with inflation and career progress.&nbsp;",

    "content": "Robert Neithart, Asst. News Editor— Twelve years ago, on Earth Day, April 22, 2010, then Denison president Dale T. Knobel entered into the American College and University Presidents’ Climate Commitment (ACUPCC), placing the university on a twenty-year path toward the achievement of carbon neutrality by the year 2030.&nbsp; Now, over a decade later, Denison has made significant strides toward offsetting its annual emissions. Director of Sustainability &amp; Campus Improvement, Mr. Jeremy King ‘97, took some time to explain the efforts the university has undertaken in the past decade, as well as the future of sustainability at Denison. Explaining the beginnings of Denison’s sustainability endeavors, King cited an environmental audit performed by a 2007 environmental studies practicum class. Revealed by the audit were some areas of particular interest with regard to the university’s environmental sustainability practices.&nbsp; These discoveries prompted Denison’s admin to formulate a course of actions to address the observed issues, resulting in the creation of a campus sustainability committee and the appointment of a sustainability officer to advise in the creation and implementation of relevant policies. With the necessary infrastructure in place by the year 2008, the university felt confident in signing the ACUPCC. King explained the main challenges that existed and persist surrounding the development of campus sustainability policies and regulations. He explained that it’s often difficult to reconcile that which benefits the environment with the pragmatic requirements of a residential campus, saying it’s difficult to balance “what we can comfortably devote toward these efforts, and still do all the other things we’re supposed to do as a college.” According to the Presidents’ Climate Commitment, since 2010, “Denison has reduced its carbon footprint by 50% through strategic investment in onsite renewable energy and the use of a green revolving loan fund that has invested in over 150 energy efficiency and water conservation projects across campus.” King explained that the past decade has seen Denison making a number of additions and omissions to campus energy sources, with particular attention being paid to the development of energy-efficient infrastructure on campus. According to King, around 16-17% of Denison’s electricity needs are met by campus solar arrays, with the remaining energy requirements coming from the Ohio electric grid, which primarily relies upon fossil fuels and other nonrenewable energy sources. Concerning heating, Denison relies heavily upon natural gas, with up to 95% of campus heating facilities being supplied by natural gas pipelines. This comes as a result of Denison’s discontinuation of coal as a power source in heating which occurred in 2014. Though the environmental impacts of natural gas are by no means insignificant, Denison was able to lower its carbon footprint by up to 15% with the discontinuation of coal as a heating source.&nbsp; Though the majority of Denison’s current energy supply is not sourced from renewable options, the university has been able to lower its carbon footprint to such an extent in part due to a combination of energy efficiency initiatives. This includes lighting improvements and motion sensors in rooms, reducing energy consumption by as much as 20% over the past decade.&nbsp; King concluded by explaining that in the past five years, Denison’s energy consumption has leveled off. He explained that the university has completed all the comparatively straightforward fixes and that in the greater context of sustainability at Denison, it is time to either invest in <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbon_credit.asp\">carbon credits </a>or long-term infrastructure like a geothermal heating system or additional solar arrays. The framework Denison will seek to implement in the next few years will likely favor long-term investment in itself rather than spending on short-term solutions in the mere interest of attaining a goal, explained King.&nbsp; For detailed information concerning plans, reports, and statistics, visit <a href=\"https://denison.edu/campus/green/forms\">https://denison.edu/campus/green/forms</a>.&nbsp;",
